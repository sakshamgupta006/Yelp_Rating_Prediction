Anyhow he accepted the deal we bought eventually. However, it turned out to be a terrible experience.  First of all, his studio is in his house, or maybe more specifically, in his garage. Certainly it is not fun to take a one-hour-photo-shoot at such a place when the temperature is over 100 outside and there is limited air-conditioning in the garage. He had to use a fan trying to make it cooler. But most importantly, his technique is not very impressive at all.  My green dress turned out to be blue in my photos!

A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.One such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the d̩cor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.My friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.We submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a ""Christmas burger"" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. Also sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. If you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. No matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!By the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.889584686
121,qDguZjZSYPOzq-je_EqO3w,3,8/1/11,0,BP6XZmb7ugvc1De9mvoQpA,4,"Bamburger is the latest entry into the inexpensive ""gourmet burger"" trend taking over Yonge Street, including Gourmet Burger Co., South Street Burger Co., Burger Shoppe and Gourmet Burger.While Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed ""diner"" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.Starting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.The menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is ""Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),"" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!We went with the ""Bambamburger ($11.50),"" which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the ""Bambamburger,"" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.Bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.If you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.",8,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-1.517135733
130,tEfmHuo_dNanyTaC5PyoOQ,0,4/25/13,0,MhkLj0c7EjcasKObXbr35A,3,"Torontonians have welcomed Momofuku with open arms and with satisfied stomachs. Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's ""Eat Drink Man Woman"", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.Three hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...Momofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.With the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.As you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.First we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!Next came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!We then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudit̩; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.And then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.Lastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,We decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.All in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.644771536
131,lJOGYkb8_n77ixVh_3zaug,0,12/2/11,0,ssYFA8RHnSTnulzUgjotcA,3,"Much like Ed Ho's recent earth Bloor West endeavour, Globe bistro's focus is on local and simple; myself, I find that to be a beautiful combination, if it's pulled off right that is.Cut off from the cozy front bar space, you can't help but notice how welcoming Globe's dining room is; distinguishingly set tables, character hardwood floors, and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space. It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.With considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.Trouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...There's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.The West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.The Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.Much the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.It's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.Perhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.560565052

This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.Axis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.Arriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.Within seconds we were greeted by the two servers/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.Taking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.Perusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.At the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.Overall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.721606265
134,sscP36MO34i5ep4QO8c7KA,1,1/28/12,0,dp6rinVjRXYaAABTU6BYsA,3,"Sometimes I ride the 501 streetcar just for something to do.  It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.At first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.My girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  As it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.The quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. Food however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.Footnote:  Seating doubles in the warmer months, when it's comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront.  Another good place to do some people watching.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.761502698
136,AercPW1B2YVNK3UsiPDkTg,0,7/27/12,0,R3vvcOvLY2q0FhAlzLQqhg,5,"Beautifully modern and discerning, Nota Bene provides the perfect setting for special occasions and casual dining alike. What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.You might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.We started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved ""Chef David's"" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.For appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalape̱o ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalape̱os offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.Next we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.For our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado pur̩e, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.We also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso a̱ejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso a̱ejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.With dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.For dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.Go try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.See you there...",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-1.356939041

After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.The brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.The thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.People rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.Make no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.So would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.",7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.718203315

That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. When I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  First off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.Fruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.Aunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College & Bathurst area.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.092247805
151,vnIdWzIB2W4j9cDcd6tHAQ,2,3/9/11,3,XC9yT_qCACdgsyLhWOjR6A,2,"La Revolucion is amazing! Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.La Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.They're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.Presentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.Interestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is. La Revolucion may be a restaurant, but a revolution it is not.",7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.523121795
157,ILlebFUb89ZozizpVGeHdQ,1,3/10/12,1,yH17eZfSnECroW_OLBaJAg,4,"Sharkey's is no more! And thank God for that. I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.So, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...A few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.The Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.The Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.Working with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.One other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.Keep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-1.565556549

Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different d̩cor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.After a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.I snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!As for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.As I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.For a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!At the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!

A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier/order taker/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.For a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entr̩e selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked ""what would I like it on?"" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with ""spaghetti,"" as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.We each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.The food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.The saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.Hey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.35278993

It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. First off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.The fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.The space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.Next time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.Check out our blog at www.tofoodreviews.com",4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.693838698

The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.Ok, on to the instruction, which is great... I have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program.  My 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board, my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing ""illegal"" strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet.  The lessons are at 6 week intervals, which is nice as really long-term commitments freak me out a bit (commitment phobe!).  They are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers, I almost felt guilty.  This guilt increased when I found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child. The instructor was fantastic!  He pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished.  And he got her strokes totally straightened out (no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle).  We did 2 sessions (one 6 weeks, the other 5 weeks (even better for my commitment issues)), and my daughter ended up in the All Star swim meet after summer swim team.  Which was a bonus, I just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming.  The 4 year old?  After one 6 week session, she was doing a version of freestyle, jumping off the diving board and I felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment.  We will be there this Winter doing their little Winter league swim team.

It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago.Anyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.I tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.My bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.Overall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour. So I will go again though it puzzles me to see some negative reviewers dissing this place for another pho joint nearby.

The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  To be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would ""incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes""--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue ""fighting"".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. If this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. In short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.

Rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 1-10 to quantify a patient's condition, or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests.  For a minor inflammatory condition, hand therapy and anti-inflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action.  Unfortunately, a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either, who is also trained with the pain scale.  Dr. Xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how I sustained it.  She used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage, herbal remedies, and acupuncture to remove the inflammation.  Now, I am working with both Dr. Xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function.  I have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery.2) I had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for.

With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.Bouldering area+ Decent number of routes and variety- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhereTop rope area-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.",3,onagImY8qLOyRGEymXcmRw,-0.067258846

Lots of elliptical machines, 5-6 treadmills, and bikes. They also have a decent variety of weight machines, free weights, and other equipment to play with.There is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing techno/dub/remix (you know, perfect workout music) to some weird classic rock/easy listening/crud, so word of advice - bring some headphones if you're going in the middle of the day. The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they're open later than most gyms on Fridays.One other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site.

They made sure all waiting patients knew of the situation and one by one called them back. About 45 minutes later, happily to my suprise, I was already called back!  Yolanda took my weight and BP  - she was professional and kind. She did my initial intake and we had a nice laugh as well. Dr Adams was in the room in about 5 minutes! Now where do I start. Dr Adams is very professional and thorough. She was interested in my home life and even what I was reading in the office! We discussed many options of treatment for my 3 reasons of being in the office. She gave me immediate referrals and advice that I felt was not only professional but thoughtful in her answers. She even called for my bloodwork and labs right there in the office instead of sending me on a goose chase to a random lab. She related to me and understood my past with what I felt very comfortable sharing with her. I have searched for a doctor in NV for 10 yrs.

In a society full of high-speed entertainment (internet, cell phones and video games) fueled by a ""I want it yesterday"" mentality, it is refreshing to see something like Toys 4 Smiles. These toys are very simple, yet very high quality. It is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was HANDMADE for them but also requires them to use their imaginations. The way I think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys don't have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem ""worth it."" Well, I am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger CARES. They are worthy of it and deserve it.

Everything was explained prior to the appointment (procedure, insurance, etc.). There are no long waits once you arrive for your appointment and everyone is friendly and courteous.  You are not rushed through appointments and he answers ALL of your questions without making you feel like you are on the clock.Dr. Guyette is very caring and shows a great deal of compassion as he performs the procedure.  As noted previously, by other patients, he personally calls you to see how you are doing after surgery; this really is unheard of these days.  After receiving the test results from the biopsy Dr. Guyette's diagnosis was absolutely correct and enough tissue was removed so that we didn't have to go back to have additional work done. The cancer was right below the neck area so it was highly visible.  It's completely healed and unless you are really looking or know it was there the stiches are nearly UNDETECTABLE!   Beautiful work......for anyone who may be considering any other procedures.   As a side note, we have also been to the Scottsdale office; both facilities are lovely. Our daughter had cystic acne when she was younger.  We originally had gone to a dermatologist and didn't like the treatment that had been prescribed; a prescription that had a lot of side effects we were not willing to risk.  Long story short, we took her to Dr. Guyette's Scottsdale office and through skin treatments, approximately 3 (laser) and using the Obaji line of products her skin completely cleared!  It's been almost 9 years, she continues to use the skin regimen they suggested and her skin has remained cystic acne free.

1615,uRjEJr_Ge0_S10P2dEgN0Q,2,6/20/16,1,6Ln2wKbDkC3taCNWVm0J3w,1,"We chose Stabella based off of a recommendation from a family friend. Unfortunately our experience wasn't everything we expected it to be. The main issues that we had was that our countertop was cut into two pieces to fit together, which sounded fine. But they cut a straight line instead of the typical angled line that you see. The straight line makes it so much easier to see. AND the worst part is that the color is so off its extremely obvious to see the line. We just feel that an effort to match the colors at the line should have been made. A few minor issues is that the countertops didn't fit the walls because our walls weren't straight. Which of course isn't Stabella's problem, but the sales rep initially told us that if this happened on sight the installers would just cut the wall a little to slide the counter tops in so everything would be flush with the wall. But when the installers got there they said they couldn't do that because the line (where the two pieces were cut and were supposed to meet) wouldn't be flush. We also decided not to get a backsplash because the sales rep talked us into how ""new"" and ""modern"" looking it would be. But then when we ran into the problems with the wall not being straight we wish we had just ordered the backsplash to hide the issues in the wall. Once again, that's not Stabella's fault that our wall wasn't straight but we just wish the sales rep had been a little more realistic instead of making everything seem like roses and daisies. In the end this left us feeling dissatisfied because we expected different things based on the initial sales pitch. Going back to the line where the two pieces met and one side was much darker than the other, they told us that the granite cutters were instructed to put the darker piece in be back. So what that told me is that Stabella was 100% aware of the drastic change in color while they were cutting our granite ... And the didn't care or even think that would bother us? They just sent it out to be installed at our house anyways. They offered to have an installer come out and apply a darkening agent to the lighter side..but why wasn't this done when the granite was still in their factory being cut? It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and things would have been done right in the first place. We declined having them come back out to apply the darkening agent because we were worried it would end up looking worse and then we'd really be screwed. Let me add that after we notified them we were declining their offer to come out and darken the countertops, we NEVER heard from them again. We NEVER at any point in the process heard an apology that we weren't 100% satisfied, they never bothered to reassure us that their work would look great after they applied the darkening agent and they'd really like to make it right...nothing. Long story short, I would never recommend Stabella and we've even gone so far as to give their name to some acquaintances and say they're who we recommend you NOT use. Stabella might get away with taking our money and leaving us dissatisfied, but we'll do our best to keep people we know from using them.",12,rbFG2hvQPA0Vca2cBGomFQ,0.240032052

I will never ever come back here again. go across the street to the other nail salon with the red sign they are friendlier and do a better job. they just happen to be closed the moment i decided to get my nails done.,0,N3nQ4CclmbNepoJmFCm7Ng,0.330880627

I've been getting my hair highlighted for 20 years and never had this kind of experience.  He fried my hair... He painted an inch size band around my face. He didn't use foils and painted it right on my scalp. The next day when I washed my hair it was sticky and stretchy like spaghetti; falling out by chunks...  absolute disaster. I spent the whole day trying to restore my hair.  I asked Shane for my money back and he got defensive and basically said I can try to fix it or you can go else where... He didn't do it right the first time, you think I'm going to trust him to do it a 2nd.   One month later and my hair is still messed up.. Don't trust Shane with coloring your hair.

1677,q70zfSFnQeKDiRltb7eXuA,0,10/10/14,1,VJXljg80PNYr5rKDI-4Ltw,1,"I attended this location on a Wednesday, one of the days they're open late. I asked the girl working at the reception if an appointment was neccessary for a cut and colour. She informed me that no, an appointment was not needed. She was nice, cheerful and informative. She told me about the current specials as well. I said that I would return the following day. The next day, I returned to this location at 5:30 with a friend. We both said that we wanted a colour and cut. It was the same girl working at the front desk. She was disappearing, on and off the phone, and otherwise out to lunch - so to speak. She gave us forms to fill out with our contact information and told us it was an hour to an hour and a half wait - Really, no appointments? She then got on the phone and made herself unavailable. My friend and I stood there waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually, the instructor, who had been busy doing another sudent's highlights in plain view, came over to take our forms and she said she would call us when our spot was open. My friend and I went to some shops in the plaza to kill time. 6:45 rolls around and we still hadn't gotten a call. We went back into the school (I don't want to call it a salon...) and let the front desk staff know we were back. We waited until 7... Nothing. They wouldn't even give us an estimate on the time. They said there were two people ahead of us. I struck up conversation with a woman who was also waiting. She said she also came in arounf 5:30 - for a ROOT TOUCH UP - and was STILL waiting. She made a good point... she could have gone home and done it herself in that time. I approached the desk around 7:15 and spoke to a student, the same student who was getting highlights done in her own hair earlier. She told me that as soon as she was done - and pointed to her own hair - she would help me. Um... ok.At 7:30, we were still not served or given a time that we would be. I approached the desk and informed them we had been waiting 2 HOURS and that this was entirely unacceptable and bullsh-t. The same instructor that was doing highlights on the student earlier had only said ""I do apologize."" I told her she should be teaching these students professionalism and correct customer service, neither which was present in this place.  I also let her know that I completely understood that this was a SCHOOL and not a salon, and that I therefore knew it would be a little slower but that it was common sense to let their customers know what was going on as we had been waiting. she kept saying ""I do apologize""... nothing else. I asked once again what the time frame for waiting would be. She then said half an hour to an hour. I asked her if she was for real... to which she said yes. I then told her we are NOT waiting three hours for this... and told her to dispose of our contact sheets that we initially filled out. I told her, now with an audience of two students - one who was the girl working the front desk - that I had attended this location the previous day and thought the prices, staff and reviews looked good. I told her I had recommended this location to my friends and family to check out. I then explained that I would retract that and that I would never recommend it again.What a terrible experience. I'm looking at this as a blessing in disguise!",0,xtR3Eg14CStCnFsyfgzMIQ,-0.95074825
1678,zBN0QWgGeeVJ4gF3UeLo6w,1,10/12/11,0,STP2dkU2UGfeZqgj3cKqMw,1,"I have got to admit it was not what I had imagined when entering Riad.  I'm thinking of a Moroccan feel, very aromatic/herbally, and very calming music.  I also imagined separate rooms for each service offered...What I had received is this.. Entering on the 2nd floor of a very old building, into just a regular room with a high chair/foot rest on one end and the manicure station next to it.  Also in the room was the Moroccan sit down/waiting room along with the front desk.  So this small room consist of all of the setting described above.  Then in another room was the facial station/massage station separated by a curtain.I wouldn't have such an issue with the setting but I did have an issue with the experience/professionalism of the service. Please see below: 1)  The short hand and toe fix is just taking off our nail polish and clipping it down.  Followed by continuous filing on your nails that actually was unnecessary because it was already to the skin part of the nail (that really hurt).  Also my cousin had stated that she had extra skin that is near her fingernail so it was already cut to wear she wanted it but the owner insisted she knew what she was doing and that she will cut it.  On top of it, she did not massage my hands nor my foot.  Shows that she really doesn't listen to her customers.  What is nice was the paraffin feet and hand that she provided. 2) Then we went into the massage/facial room.  I was given the back scrub first and my cousin was given the facial.  My back scrub was fine.  My cousin's facial was fine for the most part.  Now the funny thing is, so she gave me 20 minutes to relax and then came into the room to wake me up.  I do not think her assistant knew what she was doing for she kept asking the owner what to do.  Then, she told me I had to go shower!  What????  So she stood there in the massage room while I was naked trying to get on my robe (weird). So...she took me to a bathroom down the hall..the bathroom was so disgusting and I had to get up in the stand up shower to rinse off my back  and the paraffin hand/foot treatment.  While I was in the gross disgusting stand up shower, barefoot-keep in mind, the woman opens the door and asks if everything is okay.  Who does that?? 3) After the shower, I came back and sat in the massage room.  She told me to lay down again and she gave me I guess at most a 15 minute ""moroccan massage""-which was not relaxing at all.  And on top of that her hands slipped and punched me in the cheeks. 4) Facial was okay.  I don't think the towel they put on me was a clean towel.  I felt like it was the same towel that was probably from my feet.  The facial was nothing spectacular and it did not serve it's justice. I really, really had a bad experience with this massage place.  I feel mostly bad for my cousin because she's never been to a day spa.  What she experienced is not a good impression of what a dayspa should really be.  She was not a licensed massage therapist but yet she wants to do all services.  If you are not experienced..you should not do it.  It says on there she was a licensed podology.  She kept pushing her product line and repeatedly informed her that we were not interested.  At one point, I told her I was from the states and that I was flying home so I wouldn't be able to carry all the products onto the plane.  She suggested that I send it through the post office..ummm I don't think so.  It would cost alot of money to send out of the country.  And last but not least her hidden fees.  So I guess this living social deal did not include the taxes.  She charged 13% for Canadian taxes and then an automatic service fee (which I think is a bunch of bullshit since it was crappy services) of 17%.  So we already paid 99.00 for the services and then forced 30.00 for fees/services?  Really??  I don't think I will be going back....",0,ZRqLxkrnP1T8dVCs26X41Q,1.03490541

Today was my first and last time coming here.Let's start with my experience with scheduling the appointment. I called the salon and was answered by a man's voice with a simple, ""Hello?"" I wasn't sure if I dialed the correct number since that was the only thing he said. I asked if it was Binh's Hair Salon and he replied with ""Yeah."" As that should have been my sign to just hang up and schedule elsewhere, I proceeded to give the business the benefit of the doubt and asked if I could schedule an appointment. The man said, ""Yeah, sure,"" and hung up as soon as I said my requested date and time.So, the appointment day came and I arrived early. When it was my turn, the woman at the desk told me I could sit in the next available chair. I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, ""You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed,"" and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.Fast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.If you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate.

To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.The prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.My wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.If you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back.",0,EkOZKVkzlVJ49Jr1tPBApw,0.289421179

We planned to have dinner at T-Bones and stay the night.  We are locals, so this was supposed to be a nice stay-cation for us.   Upon check-in I was advised by front desk employee Yumi that no king bed rooms were available and we'd have to be happy with a room with 2 queen beds.  Even after showing her my reservation for the king bed room, Yumi advised me that my reservation was simply a ""preference.""  She even threatened to ""call security on us"" if we continued to express our dissatisfaction at the refusal to honor our room reservation.  Instead of taking ownership of the shortcoming, Yumi chose to blame me for ""misunderstanding"" Red Rock's online reservation system, repeatedly talking down to me as if I were too obtuse to understand that even though I booked a room with a king bed for my husband's birthday, my booking was actually only a ""preference.""  No where was this made clear when I made my reservation using Red Rock's online system.  In addition to Yumi's refusal to simply take ownership of the problem, she then threatened us with ""calling security"" due to our insistence that Red Rock honor my reservation.  I've lived in Nevada my entire life and have stayed at multiple local and strip area hotels, and have never been treated so poorly by a front desk agent.  Even after all the unpleasantries during the check in, Yumi then placed us in a room that looked directly at the parking garage.  I suppose that was her way of ""teaching us.""

Not exactly a cozy intimate dinner spot, still retains that fast-foody 'get in, eat, get out' atmosphere of most places on Green.In order to get a good cross-sample I ordered the mixed grill. Wait was a solid 15 minutes, and there was a steady trickle of customers the whole time (during spring break, I imagine they will be busier during school). The menu said they had hot tea but I saw none in evidence, just a soda fountain, cold bottle drinks behind the counter, and an iced tea server.Got the food to go and got back to the office. The chicken (shish tawook) was perfectly done, which for white meat at an understaffed restaurant (they had help wanted signs in the window) is a mark in their favor. The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.The rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to. Either way it was fresh, hot, tasty and a great deal for the price.

I've had their italian sausage sandwich (decent), the philly cheese sandwich (pretty good), pastrami (pretty good) and their chef salad. The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all. And like many reviewers stated, the fries were soggy. The fries are ALWAYS soggy. They don't punch a hole in the containers to let the steam out so once they're delivered, they are too far gone. As for the delivery time, that's absolutely crazy too. For being in a fairly close proximity to their establishment, they sure take a LONG time, even if it's just an order of salads for myself and my co-workers. The delivery guy is different every single time and they are often a bit rude. My co-worker ordered the chef salad yesterday, but was told they increased the price by almost $2.00. We unanimously agreed that we'll find some place new to get lunch. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I can't lie and say they don't have good food, they do. But when you wait well over an hour for your food, you hope it at least tastes good, and when something as easy as chili cheese fries is as egregiously bad as it was yesterday, it's hard to want to eat there again.",0,HtxS3TMKjzlCQINL9FAgzg,0.230179601

In fact I had to stop getting customer service so they could help her. She was yelling through the store and cussing at them using profanity I had my children in there. Total white trash is how she acted. I had to stay in the store until after they closed because of her stunt going over to the other store. She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E. Bell Rd. location called her several times as I was sitting right in front of her. Rik never picked up her phone. I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done. Riki Did not read her paperwork for the delivery date she messed up and she wanted them to take the blame for it And she drove the other location picked up the merchandise and didn't pay for.

The service was top notch. We began with the hot rocks appetizer. The steak was thin sliced and had a marinade that was full of flavor. You cook the steak to your liking and eat. Wonderful idea.. After the appetizer, I had the wedge salad. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors were consistent and well balanced. Yum. My husband had the caesar which he enjoyed.We both had the Filet Mignon medium which was cooked to perfection. The side sauces were so good and really brought out flavors of the meat. We ordered the asparagus, the mac and cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. My favorite was the mac and cheese... Seriously, I wish I had the recipe.. They were amazing!!

I get Brownie Bits (brownies are vegan & gluten free & amazing!!!) w/ peanut butter ice cream & their waffle cones are out of this world!  Rochelle & Ginger are super nice & run a great shop.  Thank you for the opportunity to pick up a treat while I'm out shopping!  Oh, and they do have reusable sheets now that you just dry erase marker your selections.  They are environmentally friendly too w/ compostable spoons & bowls made of potatoes & corn.  :)  LOVE IT!",3,1sVC_xVc9aTzyYPLL39AZg,2.400394429

Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.The Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.We wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.The service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.Our receipt invited us to share our experience at a ""Talk2us"" link, which only produced a ""survey error.""Having had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area.",0,jYDa14HsvZnY0C3pulotYA,0.439757088

It's a bigger stage & venue than when it was at Palazzo (where it reigned from 2008 thru 2011). Other than size, another difference is that this new theater does not have a balcony. You are either in the front half (Orchestra section), or back half (Mezzanine). When I got my tix, I was told that the last row (Row M) was only 75 feet away from the stage, implying that even the last row has a good view of the stage.

I get that I am supposed to tip on the full amount - I can do the math - the 'non-negotiable' automatic 15% tip on the total INCLUDING tax is ludicrous.  Given this was not disclosed in advance or on the Groupon, it's also not legal.  A gratuity is a gratuity, and I would have given my host Nasir a larger tip given the option to set my own bar.  Smart businesses know that customers are marketing vectors and correspondingly treat them well, even if they are there on a deal.  Unfortunately, O.Noir is pleased to rely on its position as a novelty experience rather than stand behind its food and service standards to drive more customers through the door.  Their prerogative I suppose, but it can't be good for repeat business.I was also charged a random $15 dollar charge 'for using a Groupon' which was not stipulated anywhere on the deal.  This is truly what made me feel cheated and left a sour taste in my mouth.  My bill was identical to what it would have been without the deal = lame.  The wait to pay for said bill post-meal was crazy - they could use a more streamlined payment system (two operational tills would be nice).The food itself was hit or miss - drink prices weren't outlandish, though considering you're apt to knock one over, this is a good thing.  I had the steak, which was great - my girlfriend had the shrimp/risotto, which was way oversalted and overdone to the point you could patch drywall with it.  The atmosphere is what you are here for, but even blind you can feel banquet style chairs and inordinately tight spacing with other couples/groups.  Your other senses heighten and you end up hearing a lot of other peoples' conversations very audibly, and I happened to be seated next to the most vapid and inanely redundant human beings in existence, rendering the experience even more unpleasant.  Guests in our room almost got in a blind fistfight over somebody using an indiglo watch for a second, which was entertaining in a Jerry Springerish sense.  That second star is for the host Nasir - he's a righteous dude.

Here's the story...........  I bought a 2009 Maxima from them in December.  I got what I wanted, traded my truck that was falling apart for a newer, nicer used car from Horne Kia.  I went in there with a loan from my bank already approved so I didn't need their financing.  I went in there with the loan approval number and was happy when they told me everything was good and they would get the information about my new car to the bank so they could complete the loan.  They didn't.  They opened a new loan with my bank so that they could make some money off the new loan that they started.  Now, this normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, aside from it causing my credit to be run again, but they lied about it to me, which is unacceptable.So, with the purchase of my new, used car, I get a free oil change when it's due.  This brings me to this last Saturday, when I brought it in for it's first oil change.  I made an appointment for 9:30AM on Saturday to do a basic oil change.  My wife and I drop it off and they tell us it will take and hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes.  No problem since they seemed rather busy, we'll go get some breakfast.  So it's after 12:30 and still no call, I figure they may have forgotten to call us and we just head back there since it's been three hours.  Much our dismay, we get there and it's still in the same spot it was in when we left.  I go into the office, which is now virtually empty, and speak with the service advisor I dealt with earlier.  He tells me that they had to go get an oil filter from a parts store since it was a Nissan they were working on and they were a Kia dealership.  Well, that makes sense if I hadn't made an appointment 8 days earlier and they weren't expecting me.  But here's the real kicker; a 2009 Maxima takes the exact same oil filter as virtually every Kia from 2008 and before, as well as some 2010 Kia's.Apparently this service advisor thought I wouldn't know this, as most people wouldn't, I'm sure.  When I asked him again what part it was they had to go get from a parts store, giving him the chance to be honest with me, he lied again.  Therefore, I presented him with this information and he instantly turned quite sheepish, not knowing what to say.  I proceeded to tell him that all we wanted was some honesty and they obviously don't deliver that at this dealership.

First fyi: the company charges 80 dollars an hour (for two movers).  There is a minimum 2 hour block to use the services.

Also, they taped shut my dresser drawers and file cabinet doors with a tape they assured me would not damage the paint.  And when I started peeling the tape away, half of the paint came off with it.  They do not take of belongings and they scratched up the entire surface of my 1 month old white desk to the point I had to paint the entire thing over in a dark color.If you're in need of trustworthy movers, try to use bekins or another more well established company.

The spiced chutney was a pleasant start to the meal while my friend and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Tom Collins Cucumber GazpachoLake Erie farms cucumber, lemon cress, preserved lemon, Canadian gin I enjoyed this version quite a bit. Never having tried a non-tomato gazpacho before, this was my first pick for lunch. I was very pleased with the light, refreshing flavour and great consistency. Unlike Biff's gazpacho, it was neither too creamy nor smooth. I prefer it with texture, and this one definitely rivals Boulevard Cafe's tomato-based gazpacho. I did not notice the gin, which is a good thing since I'm not a fan and I'd have to do a blind taste test to see if it made a difference. This was my favourite starter.Smoked Black Cod BrandadeCrispy shallot rings, smoked paprika essence, confit garlic crostiniThe crispy shallot rings were great with the paprika essence topped with a generous helping of the brandade. The texture was similar to very thick mashed potatoes, and the cod flavour was not too strong. This was the overall favourite appetizer of the table (but not mine!)Shaved Fennel & Purple Basil Cress SaladSpiced pistachio, taggiashi olive dust, orange gel̩eI enjoyed this salad - the fennel had a good bite, the pistachios were great, and I enjoyed the orange gel̩e quite a bit. The gel̩e was sweet with a firm texture, which paired well with the vegetables.Lake Erie Pickerel Wild rice coriander salad, Millbank green peas, marjoram cress, earth chardonnay vinaigretteIn spite of my typical hesitation to order fish, I have tried it at all of my Summerlicious outings this year. I was very glad that I did not miss out on this dish! The pickerel was cooked with the skin, which was nice and crispy and the wild rice salad was wonderful. The fish was seared very well, and was neither dry nor oily and was my favourite entree. I would order the fish at Globe Bistro again based on this! Swiss Chard Torte VerdeBest Baa Farm feta, charred tomato coulis, blonde fris̩e, chivesThe warm, baked feta on top of tomato coulis was quite savoury without an overpowering feta flavour. The tomato coulis had a cheesy taste and thick texture - I personally would have preferred a stronger charred tomato flavour instead but it was a great sauce to swirl the torte around before each bite.Seared Cumbrae's Flank SteakDuck fat Yukon chips, vine ripe tomato, scallion, Triple Crunch aioliCarefully cooked, the steak was wonderfully pink and juicy. The aioli was a great accompaniment and steak's usual partner in crime - the fries - were quite tasty. Thickly cut and cooked in duck fat, they were enjoyed with each tender slice of steak. This was the overall favourite.Callebaut Dark Chocolate TorteEspresso mousse, Cherry Lane Farms black cherry sugarTorte, torte, torte! Topped with mousse, this thick treat was a nice way to end the meal. I liked the torte at Biff's  a bit more, as it was a more moist and was served with a fruity sauce but this was a nice, satisfying variation as well. I love the density of torte, and the flavour of dark chocolate is something that I'll never tire of. I wasn't a huge fan of the espresso mousse - while good, I would prefer something a little sweeter/fruity/saucy for this dense dessert.Globe Summer Berry ""Mess""Vanilla spiced meringue, bacon infused whiskey, Ontario berriesYum! I'm not usually a fan of meringue or  vanilla but this dessert was light and pleasant. The meringue was airy and sweet, and a great combination with the Ontario strawberries. The stiff peaks were lightly browned and the vanilla flavour was very pleasant with the sweet berries. Ewenity Cr̬me Fraiche Panna Cotta Candied lemon zest, wild blueberry soupThis is the first panna cotta that I've enjoyed at a Summerlicious meal. I usually find it too creamy in taste, however joined with the blueberry soup and candied lemon this was great. I particularly enjoyed the lemon zest! The blueberry soup was akin to syrup and I'll admit that I took some torte and gave it a good swirl - it was fantastic. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at Globe Bistro - definitely a nice way to end this year's Summerlicious escapades. Great service, good food made with local ingredients, and wonderful decor - a surefire recipe for a nice lunch or dinner. A pleasant bistro to go with friends or clients and it has a rooftop patio!Pics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/07/summerlicious-2010-globe-bistro.html",1,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.709434535
2836,y-Zbg19VSb-k15A_yzruYg,2,9/11/10,0,g_nACXAx32a3IZ17V8zJ9w,1,"I went to Frank's for a late night dessert and I was really disappointed. I thought that it would be good, from positive online reviews and the fact that the AGO Cafe's treats also get positive feedback. I've also heard lovely things about their brunch. Unfortunately, the desserts were not fresh at all - way overpriced for what we got. Is it worth returning for a meal?Summer Berry PuddingRaspberries, strawberries, red currants, and vanilla whipped creamWhile tasty, I think that this would've been better topped on top of a cake rather than being served as a messy slab of pudding. It was more mushy than pudding-y.Coffee and DonutChocolate espresso pot de creme with dulce de leche whipped cream and cinnamon sugared mini donutCute presentation - chilled pot de creme had a nice chocolate-espresso flavour, but I wish it was a bit stronger or denser or had bits of chocolate in it.The donut was quite disappointing. Despite being made in-house, both the twist and the donut were stale and lacked flavour. I would have been happier with a Timbit from Tim Hortons - for 16 cents!",4,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,1.153465926
2838,5BPv_vAnRp5EKdmacqvrLw,2,9/12/10,0,dthp-EdVzxsiKnqrd2Dh9A,4,"After another ketchup-y plate of pad-thai at a local restaurant, I decided that I had to hunt for a great traditional version in Toronto. Mission accomplished!A very late dinner on Pi-Tom's patio coupled with pleasantly humid weather made a few of us reminisce of travels to Asia. Usually bustling & full during dinner, we arrived around 9pm and had full reign of the patio! Still decorated from the Pride Parade, the colourful patio is enveloped in plants and trees, making you forget that you're in the downtown core.  Yum Mamuang (Mango Salad)Green mango, red onion, chili, mint leaves, lemon juiceA great start to our dinner, the ingredients were fresh and the lemon juice-chili combination complimented the mangoes quite well. The mangoes were ripe, but still had enough bite so you can get a good stab with your fork each time. The balance between fruit and vegetables was great - too much red onion can kill a mango salad.Fish CakesDeep-fried ground white fish mixed with chili and long beanWhat a pleasant surprise - when I heard ""fish cakes"" I was expecting spongy slivers of processed fish. Instead, we received tasty well-marinated slices accompanied with a hearty peanut sauce. The sauce was full of peanuts and flavour with a smooth, non-oily texture. I ended up scooping leftovers on some rice, yum!Chicken Satay4 skewers of marinated chicken served with cucumber saladTender, juicy chicken with a sweet & salty flavour - I wish these were sold on the street. They'd be the perfect snack! A simple yet winning appetizer.The servers were very friendly. The food came quick throughout the night, and upon request they gave us a jug of water to save the waitress the hassle of constantly refilling our glasses. We did not realize that they closed at 10pm, but they did not rush us out of the restaurant and did not seem annoyed that we were unknowingly staying well past their closing time. Authentic Pad ThaiThai rice noodles stir fried with sweet & sour tamarind sauce, chicken, shrimp, root vegetable, bean sprouts, tofu, coconut sauce, wrapped in a fried egg crepeWhat a difference from ketchup-based pad thai! Tamarind is by far the superior sauce. While ketchup (or ""sweet and sour tomato sauce"" as some restaurants call it) is very sugary, tamarind gave it a more tangy flavour and the portion in the egg crepe was quite generous. It wasn't sopping with sauce, and there meat, noodle, and sprouts ratio was great, and everything was cooked quite nicelyDuck CurryRoasted duck in curry, lychee, bamboo shoots, peppers, and basilFull of bell peppers, broccoli and bamboo shoots, this aromatic curry was deliciously packed with flavour and roasted duck. To be honest, I didn't notice lychee...probably because I was too busy wolfing everything down!The curry was wonderfully seasoned; sweet, comforting and the favourite dish of the night for our table.Peanut ChickenChicken stir-fried with peanut sauce & long beanThe simple peanut chicken dish was very flavourful with moist bites of chicken. As expected, it had a very strong peanut taste, but wasn't at all pasty in texture. While yummy on a summer night, I can really see myself enjoying a bowl in the winter - and Pi-Tom's does delivery!Plamuek Pad Prik (Spicy Squid)Squid in hot pepper sauce with bamboo shoots and basil sauceA generous offering of vegetables and squid, this plate disappeared quickly! Green beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, onions, and squid, all smothered and cooked in an addictive basil sauce. Even when the food was gone, we were spooning the sauce on rice until the plate was super clean!Goong Pong Ka-Ree (Stir Fried Shrimp Dinner Special)Stir-fried shrimp with curry powder, egg, onion, chili garlic sauce, sweet peppers.  Served with pineapple fried rice and pineapple salad.Another favourite of the table - although the pineapples were canned, the salad was nice to scoop up with the shrimp and rice. The fried rice wasn't greasy (something that I'm usually wary of), and the shrimp had a great kick that kept us going back for more. By the end of the night, all of us left happy & satisfied. Every single dish was full of flavour, the service was pleasant, and the patio was welcoming. A surprisingly delicious find, just off of Yonge Street and I will be back to try their soups and sticky-rice dessert!*Update*Pi-Tom's Mango Sticky Rice  (~$6)Thumbs down. I suppose I can't fault them for the blah mango - peak season has come and gone. Mango Sticky Rice is supposed to be salty & sweet...I would've liked a bit more of a salty flavour in the coconut-milk. I could be wrong, but perhaps the rice wasn't soaked enough in the coconut-milk or maybe there wasn't enough (to my liking anyways. I'm no Thai-dessert expert) because I would've liked a milkier consistency.",8,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,1.309858125
2845,j1yBqI57HIyVP_e1N374cQ,1,9/11/10,1,IFvl7-D_lFtOsNjr-Hc1VA,5,"My friend and I happily feasted three mains and an appetizer. That's not to say that the portion sizes aren't generous - because they are! It was just that good. Instead of picking two out of three entrees that we really wanted, we just tacked on another plate. You gotta make the visit count, right?Excited to Hoof-it-up, I got there a bit early and was surprised to find a line quickly gather behind me. Luckily, I was relaxing on the bench & enjoying the Sunday morning otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a table (not that the bar would've been bad). By 9:45AM, quite a few fellow brunchers were eagerly peering through the window in anticipation of the 10AM opening time.The cafe itself is quite small, so go early if you want to avoid a wait or would prefer a seat by the window. Similarly, I arrived at Black Hoof right when they opened at 6PM, and just managed to grab a table. I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar though, they have fantastic cocktails and the service is jovial and chatty. However, for a group of more than 3 people a table is clearly better.Bone Marrow Strawberry BeignetsWinning Combination: Cinnamon, Sugar, Bone Marrow, Strawberries & Long PeppersThese delicious little bone marrow pastries are coated in sugar and cinnamon. The donuts were hot, fresh, and filled with a sweet strawberry and long pepper jelly. Deep fried bits of joy, these were the perfect size and a tasty $5 appetizer. More please!The two other starters are currently available for $5; a pastry filled with bacon as well as ribs in a beer sauce. While curious about the others, these donuts were a winning choice. Well...honestly based on the entire meal, I'm convinced that anything would be a solid option!Beef Tongue Grilled CheeseWhen I spotted this on the menu, succulent memories of Beef Tongue on Brioche from Black Hoof wafted through my mind. Slathered and fried, the buttery bread had toasty grill marks and neatly sandwiched an extremely tender and generous portion of beef tongue. I needed to erase the disaster that was Friday's T&T's rubbery beef tongue from my mind and this just blew it away. Hello satisfaction.Packed with comforting flavour, every bite made me stop to savour the combination of Provolone, Brie, crispy-buttery bread, and amazing thinly-shaved beef tongue. The little piggy-skewer with 4 pickles was a nice touch, similar to Black Hoof's Beef Tongue on Brioche Sandwich. Between the two, I'd say that this was better...but trust me...they are both delicious. Not bad for my first grilled cheese sandwich!Suckling Pig Eggs BennyPerfectly runny egg yolks, light Hollandaise sauce over pickled jalape̱oThe Eggs Benny was perfectly poached. Warm yolk slowly oozed out when pierced with a fork, and every bite was covered in heavenly Hollandaise sauce. The sauce wasn't too rich, and did not mask the wonderful porky flavour on top of the fresh biscuit. The suckling pig had a barbecue flavour, and reminded me of very tender pulled pork without the sauce. The arugula had a lemony zip and the dish was surrounded by pork rinds. I could be wrong, but the rinds tasted like they were made a bit earlier as they were a bit soft rather than hot and crispy. They were spiced with barbecue powder. While a nice touch, I didn't care so much for them.I recently told a friend that my next food-hunt would be for Toronto's best Eggs Benedict. However, I'm pretty sure that now I've tasted this, there is no need. Even without the suckling pig, this eclipses all other Eggs Benny dishes I've ever had.Brioche French Toast with Foie GrasO-M-G.I could easily leave the description as that, because that is all that was running through my mind when we received it, while I was eating it, and after it was done.The Brioche French Toast was perfect - the thick French bread was perfectly battered & fried, covered in sweet-syrupy goodness, roasted macadamia nuts, a dollop of creme fraiche, and bright red strawberries. Oh, and quite possibly the largest serving of Foie Gras that I've ever seen i my life.Words can't describe how great I thought it was - sweet syrup, hot fresh brioche, seared Foie Gras, macadamia nuts, creme fraiche, and fruit. How could this not be amazing?! Now I want every restaurant to start making French Toast with brioche. Like the Eggs Benny, this wins the C&T prize for Toronto's Best French Toast. Sorry Kalendar, but your banana & mango stuffed French toast was just trumped BIG TIME.A $26 plate French Toast might sound quite steep (it's $12 for the French Toast and $14 for the Foie Gras) but I definitely think that it's worth a try at least once. Go with a few friends and split it if you need to...Everything about the the meal was great. From the upbeat and friendly service to the colours and presentation of each plate.Pics : http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/08/hoof-cafe-charcuterie-brunch-love.html",2,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,0.618671431
2846,pZ1quwXnYozLIZIVABojhw,1,9/11/10,1,7WNFDEMY0_hFO_EWROecJg,4,"Visit #1Charcuterie Platter ($16 small/$25 large) & Thuet Bread ($2 small/$4 large)This is a wonderful introduction for those who have never tried charcuterie. Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.All offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.The star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.Roasted Bone Marrow ($9)Hollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.Tongue in Brioche ($13)The sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.Incredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.Raw Horse Sammy w/ Hot Sauce ($22)Fresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The ""HORSE"" spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.Visit #2Crispy Pig Ear SaladStrips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressingI liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.The pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...Fluke CrudoFluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.I really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)N'Duja & Corn TagliatelleHouse tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.Mmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!Pork Belly, Squid,& MelonBaby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.While the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.Calf's Brain RavioliHouse ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavingsSo...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)Pics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/08/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.htmlPics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/09/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html",2,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA,1.496296905

It's a okay place to grab a drink and their fish and chips is pretty decent but the service and some of the other things off the menu is a gamble. I've given it a try several times and there have been times when everything has been good and times when everything has been bad. So unfortunately on my last experience is what will be cited most. We ended up with 3 different waitresses taking orders from us (weird) and NEVER  order the crunchy chicken sandwich. The first one came our and I took a bite which was just bread I then opened it up to find that I had scared the chicken into the furthest corner of the bun. It was literally the size of 2 quarters and that's generous. The good news was they apologized and had another one ordered right away.

It was Sunday Brunch and we arrived around 1pm.  The line was loooooong but that was expected.  Once seated at the table, my husband and daughter decided to tackle the ONCE AGAIN LONG LINE at the meat carving station while I decided to tackle the shorter line at the seafood station since I was already starving at this point.   While chowing down on the SUPER SALTY crab legs, I wondered where my husband and daughter were since they still haven't sat down to eat with me.   It nearly took them 30 minutes standing in line at the meat carving station!!  By the time they joined me at the table, I was ready to sample the rest of the food.  I then walked all the way towards the back to the Asian section (by the way the flow of the buffet just doesn't make sense!) to maybe try some sushi or sashimi.   There weren't that many good sushi selections either that's all they has or they just don't replenish fast enough.   I decided to skip the Asian section and walk my way towards the front.  I wanted some cured meats and cheese, but yet again the Parmesan cheese was a whole big block -no shavings or pieces one would have easy access to.  I was looking around for a knife maybe I thought one had to shave the cheese off himself, but no tool was around!  I was really getting frustrated at this point, but I still decided not to give up and try the meat carving station.  I had wishful thinking that the line was going to be shorter this time than when my husband and daughter were here.  Needless to say, the line was not any faster but at this point this was my last resort the last station i want to try since they have Prime Rib - my favorite, so I patiently wait for my turn.  Finally I get Prime Rib with Au Jus on my plate and  FINALLY join my family at the table, to only find out they are ALREADY DONE EATING!  I don't blame them since I was gone for almost 30 minutes!!!   To top it all off, the Au Jus that soaked my Prime Rib was sooo salty that I could only eat 3 bites out of that meat!  I was enraged at this point that I didn't even care to try their desserts!    Not being able to eat at the same time with my family because of the ridiculously long lines at the food stations and to be fed salty dishes is just absurd!   All in all, Bachannal Buffet DOES NOT live up to the hype!   The food is so much better elsewhere!

It literally put me off of Indian food for long time. I did not find the food to be terribly fresh, as though it had been sitting in those chafing dishes for hours.

It was extremely frustrating being asked multiple times for the same docs and having my closing date delayed at least twice due delays on their part ( they actually contacted my seller and explained that they were the reason for the closing delay).  The final mixup was on the day of closing when they included impounds in my final payment when a i had clearly requested and  signed documents saying I did not.  They acknowledged the error and  told me the docs would have to go back to underwriting again, thus causing another delay in closing. I knew that my seller would not go for a 3rd delay and I knew I had a good deal on the table.  I was told that the  impounds could possibly be removed during the servicing process, so I accepted the current situation and closed the loan with the mpounds to eliminate my risk.  I was not happy.

He had extraordinary reviews, so we provide this one just to present our different experience.He was immediately reachable, very prompt with arranging a home visit, and always very confident in his assertions.  While his speed in identifying our problem and readiness to discuss his (possibly excellent) credentials repeatedly would be a positive to many, we felt that he reached his conclusions a bit TOO quickly and mentioned his background and all his competitors' inadequacies TOO frequently.  Possibly just a clash of personalities, but...We weren't feeling confident in the diagnosis and remediation he proposed and looked for another opinion just to do our due diligence (but we are certainly NOT experts).  We subsequently learned of a few red flags:  (1)  MoldEx does their own specimen collection (not the actual testing, though) which other contractors believe is a conflict of interest (i.e., there's an incentive to find a problem and to prove that the work has resolved it).(2)  A more thorough inspection revealed an entirely different source for our moldy smell which would NOT have been addressed had we gone with the MoldEx remediation plan.During this process (before we found what is likely the right source), we contacted Daryl to ask a few follow-up questions, planning to hire him.  I must have given him the (totally incorrect) impression that other contractors were standing by to do the work for us, because his brief response was that he was busy and must pass on our job.  ""I'm sure the people providing you with this information will be more than happy to take care of you"", he replied.  We took this to mean that he was offended by our potentially getting other opinions.  We felt rather put off and left a fairly scathing review.  Next day he called to inquire about it (I appreciated that).  I explained what our concerns were and that we did not, in fact, have any other options available to us.  I revisited my questions with him; he told me he'd talk if I took down the review (I was unimpressed with that).  He called the next day when I hadn't, then tracked down my spouse's work number and left a message there.  We were left with a fairly sour taste.",15,jied6iDthSbNjw0bopOwTQ,-0.961481554

I have a 2 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath, 2 story with a good size 2 car garage. The utilities are reasonable. My biggest gas bill was $42 in December and my electric bill for May was about $45.

The curry was described as ""very mild"" but was spicier than the sweet/hot thai dish which was described as ""spicy"". The teriyaki was served with rice, but there was not enough sauce to put the rice to use, whereas the thai dish was swimming in cloyingly sweet sauce that tasted like it came from a jug. The California King Crab roll was small for the price, though the flavor was apparently good.There was a wait at the door for a few minutes while they prepared a table, but when we were shown to the cramped booth, there were several empty and clean booths on the way, why the wait?Our waiter was also a bit awkward, bringing entr̩es out over a five minute span instead of at the same time.",0,NaORI-qPPhej_Ce_sRH2Iw,-0.759236745

I think 2.5 would be a fair and accurate rating to give but 2 is my only option here. Yelp considers 2 to be ""Meh. I've experience better"" what a great way to sum this place up.Our first two negative experiences happened at check in, the receptionist were nice, some of them were hard to understand but I don't think it was any fault of there's, more age related. Anyways we got our key card and proceeded upstairs to our non-smoking room. I swear, i've walked into some rooms that might have a ""faint"" smell of cigarettes, but this 1st room was as if someone took cartons of cigarettes, put them in the middle of the room and little them all on fire before throwing them out the window just as we walked in. We both were sick with colds so could not stand the stench. We walked downstairs again and politely told the front desk what happened. She apologized and said they were trying to fix this issue (it must happen a lot) but at least they are trying to fix it. Okay fine, second times a charm, we quickly are handed a new set of keys with a different room to test out.Our second room smells fine, and we quickly get excited, but it was short lived as we try to turn on the lights and soon realize that not a single light switch works, including the bathroom. At this point i'm viewing the hotel as a hike to and from the front desk and consider activating my step counter.Our 3rd visit to the desk we are polite again and explain what happened in this room, the women now seems amazed (maybe most people give up by the 3rd try?). So she quickly walks away and mumbles something about manager, she is being nice, i honestly cannot understand what she says though. I look at my female friend for a translation and she shrugs and mumbles manager in recognition of all i understood. Okay so the manager comes out and starts typing a novel on the keyboard and apologizing, he is also very nice and courteous, he helped us with 1 night resort fee which we definitely appreciated and moved us into our 3rd and hopefully final room.Upon entering our 3rd room everything is in order, smells, electricity, running water... so i'm happy camper, my female friend collapses into the bed in exhaustion from our hike in zion park and now in Circus Circus. Day 1 complete at Circus Circus... why is the clown so scary looking?Day 2Goes fine, the building doesn't explode but watch out for the toilets, they flush so hard i swear they could suck your arm down with it. Okay not really, but they will surprise you if you're not ready for it.So it's 10pm, (12/17) I tell my friend we should watch a movie, she shrugs without thought while staring at an ipad. I think she knows i'm tempting fate at this point.. I click the menu and it tells me to call the front desk for movies. Okay...that's a little outdated but sure. I pickup the phone and make the call, front desk doesn't answer, instead it is the operator, who tries to connect me again... no luck, so she tells me they will call me back in a minute. I wait 5 minutes and call back, she tells me they haven't forgotten about me and hangs up again. I wait 30 minutes and call back, reminding her it has now been over 30 minutes, she apologizes and says she will personally go check on why the hotel wont accept my money for a movie (not those exact words, but seriously..) I wait another 30 minutes and start writing this review. I have now been waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes including the writing of this review.. I'm not one to give up but honestly. I give up Circus Circus, if you don't have customer service or accountability, you do not have a hotel.Sincerely,RyanPrior customer service manager of 3 retail stores and now traveling",0,GM0mRYg3mMYoQdwB_BT9jw,1.566269853

The menu is a full three panel - front and back - array of original creations, ranging from the unique and beautiful Lazy Sundaes to the Scoop du Jour - one or two scoops with cream and cherries.  Of course, you can also just select from the many offered toppings and ice cream flavours to create-your-own.  Ice cream includes peanut butter, nutello chocolate (not to be confused with Nutella) and vanilla-honey, amongst others.  On top of that, they throw in a freshly made crepe or waffle, some bananas or strawberries, chocolate sauce and a couple of dollops of the clearly-in-house-made whipped cream, and you have a dessert that will put you in a delightful sugar coma!It was close to 11:00 p.m. when I made my way to Demetre's, but there were still a good number of sweet-toothed patrons enjoying some of the sugary creations - this was clearly be more than your regular two-scoop waffle-cone kind of place.  They make all of the ice creams on the premises, using fresh Ontario dairy and utilizing a special freezing process that prevents ice crystals from forming in the carefully crafted artisan frozen treats.The servings provide you more than enough ice cream and extras to share comfortably, but my group decided to be gluttonous and each have their own; three ice cream crepe dishes, one with peanut butter ice cream, one nutello chocolate and one with the house chocolate.  The best thing about these desserts, right down to the whipped cream, is the balance of sweetness with the bold flavours.  There is a truly special way they do things that prevents the strong flavours from overwhelming the whole dish.  The peanut butter ice cream was nowhere near that almost sticky consistency and too-rich taste that can be attached to some PB creations; the whipped cream was a clean and creamy compliment to the light chocolate syrup; and the fruit was fresh and surprisingly bright considering the winter months.I am a self-proclaimed cheap dessert-eater, but here I felt like I got much more than I paid for.  The dishes come in at about $10 each - but, if you're sharing, which is probably more appropriate than polishing off a whole plate alone, it is quite affordable - especially for the top-notch quality.The cherry on top was the service.  It was fast, friendly, and appropriately attentive.  A few casual checks were done here and there and an offer for re-fills was made - so simple, but so important.If you haven't done so yet, check out Caf̩ Demetre. It's a sweet spot to get some sweets.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.681514378
4547,HudCKBs3crW5mjaD7Y89gQ,1,12/22/10,0,#NAME?,4,"Sweet Flour bakeshop is a tremendously original idea. It's a custom bakeshop in Bloor West Village that revolves primarily around the cookie. Their website lays out their philosophy best: there is nothing quite like a cookie just out of the oven. That cookie, just out of the oven, and the experience that goes along with its creation, is exactly what Sweet Flour is all about. I say 'revolves primarily around the cookie' because although your perfect cookie is their goal, they don't stop at cookies. Everything from homemade granola to muffin tops and ice cream sandwiches to gingerbread is there for you to claim and customize as your own. For me, Sweet Flour delivers the experience of one of my best-remembered childhood memories: watching cookies bake through the oven window and patiently waiting for them to cool just enough to eat.So what exactly does it mean to 'customize' cookies? At Sweet Flour, it means you're in charge of what's getting made. It all starts by picking what you want to bake. You can choose muffin or cookie batter, and from a couple variations of either of those, but your best bet is probably the classic cookie. It's perfectly sweet with hint of vanilla and butter. From there you decide what you want in the cookie; trust me, it won't be an easy decision to make. There are tons of different treats ranging from chunks of chocolate to crunchy nuts to soft dried fruits. You get a choice of two. Then they mix it, form it, and bake it ultra fast. Your cookie is perfectly hot and baked and in your hands in about two minutes.Sweet Flour doesn't just stop at custom cookies. They also cater parties with baked goods, bake and decorate custom cookies for events, do cookiegram deliveries, and even package their cookies into kid's loot bags.One thing is made perfectly clear from the minute you walk in until the minute you step out the door; these people care about quality. Everything in use seems fresh and high grade. From the glass bottled locally source milk to the fair-trade coffee to those incredible cookie ingredients, all of it seems to be bought with both quality and you in mind. A rare outlook nowadays when everything seems to be about the bottom line.The aspect about Sweet Flour I immediately noticed is that their space has expansion written all over it. I'm sure this is the only one, but the layout, decorating, even the logo, all of it made it feel strangely familiar, like I was somehow used to it. This place definitely screams franchise, and I wouldn't be shocked to eventually see one downtown, at the mall, even at the airport. While that certainly isn't a bad thing for the business, I personally felt as though it sort of takes away from the connection to my childhood feeling.I know there are a couple more places in Toronto that do the same sort of custom cookie experience that Sweet Flour does, but I'm not sure who did it first. The only thing I can say is that I've been to Sweet Flour twice, and both times it was a pretty good experience from start to finish. However, although the cookie does come out hot, fresh, and made to order, it did cost almost 8 bucks for two of them and a glass of milk. Seems a little steep to me, but as a treat, it's nearly perfect.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.760104068
4559,MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA,2,1/22/12,0,Bsaig80p_SxxCXca3O6cUA,5,"Let me start by saying I am truly a Latin American food snob. I am fortunate enough to know what the good stuff - the real stuff - tastes like, and I resent those who do it poorly. It's not difficult food to make, but it takes both time and love to create great Latin American dishes, and it frustrates me when I see melted cheese from a jar smeared on store-bought chips that are passed off as ""Mexican food"" in restaurants. So it was a relief and a thrill to hear that the head chef from The Black Hoof was helming Grand Electric and promised, ""Mexican food, craft beer, brown liquor and loud music.""I met my dinner companion across the street at The Mascot at 5:45 and watched as a line started to form outside Grand Electric. The baristas suggested we get ourselves over there before the line up got too long, warning us we'd be eating at 9pm if we didn't get it in gear. We dutifully lined up at 5:50pm behind two parties. Within five minutes the line had extended half a block behind us. At 6:02pm, the doors opened and people flooded inside. We were shown to a table for two and marveled at just how quickly the small space filled up. Tables were gone by 6:05 and the bar was full a minute later. Music blared, servers started making their rounds and Grand Electric was off and running.The bar is quite the thing to behold. Bourbon-heavy, it is run by enthusiastic and well-informed staff.  It towers over patrons and is a great focal point for the restaurant. In addition to bourbon, you can try several craft beers including Churchkey and Canucklehead cask ale. Both are excellent, but if you haven't tried a cask ale, you should know it's not carbonated. Don't let that dissuade you from checking it out, though, as it has a fruity and slightly bitter taste. You'll be hooked after your first taste.The menu for Grand Electric located at the back of the restaurant on a giant chalkboard. It is split up into appetizers, tacos, specials and dessert. Given the advanced buzz that's been generated, we opted to try as many dishes as possible. We had the guacamole and nachos (an excellent test of a Mexican restaurant's mettle), tuna ceviche, chicken frito appetizers, one of each taco, and in the end, we went for the key lime pie for dessert.Beers in hand, we eagerly awaited our food which came out surprisingly fast considering the kitchen must have gotten just crushed with all of us arriving at once. First up came the guacamole and chips. The dip was generously salted and had lots of lime juice, essential elements both. Without enough of those two simple ingredients, guacamole falls flat, but this was the best restaurant-made I've ever had (oh, and it comes with a huge serving of light-as-air pork chicharron as a garnish; a great aesthetic touch as it towers over the guacamole & chips). The fresh corn tortilla chips were also both well seasoned and delicious.A plate of three tacos was delivered to us, and we hung on every word our server said as she explained which taco was which. The first three were the sweet pork belly al pastor with pineapple, the fried queso (cheese) and spicy arbol chicken. It's not that spicy, I promise, especially considering some of the other choices. Of these, the only miss was the queso which I thought could have benefited from some salt. Having said that, the other two were simply wonderful, especially the pork belly.  We also tried the Baja fish taco, a lightly breaded tilapia fillet topped with bright, fresh cabbage. The textures of the soft tortilla and the crunchy, crispy toppings had us grinning from ear to ear.Not-to-be-forgotten is the chicken frito dish we ordered: a mound of crispy, fried chicken pieces slathered in a sweet and citrus-y coating and sprinkled with healthy doses of cilantro, jalapeno peppers slices and little, red, evil chile peppers. I like heat, but skipped over the red chiles in favor of the jalapenos. Sweet, sour, spicy, juicy, crispy, hot...there was nothing about this dish that should be changed. Ever. I will most definitely be ordering this one again.Overall, this was one of the most fun and delicious meals I've had in Toronto. The atmosphere is supercharged in the restaurant, filled with happy customers taking pictures of and devouring the food coming out of the kitchen. While you can hardly say that each dish on the menu is truly, authentically Mexican, it hardly matters when it's this good. A word to the wise: go early or you will be waiting for hours for a seat, but even if you do end up waiting, it'll be worth it. There is no other place in the city putting out food like this.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-1.738287499
4564,WlkOFaqRL5vtYZZ7fl4x1Q,3,12/3/10,0,LSoQi3v7L0R9fcjzHuW5AA,4,"- It wasn't that long ago that Bloordale was a strip of Toronto that felt neglected. In fact, most people may feel like its still neglected, but looking around, it's evident that there are signs of improvement. That's where Three Speed comes in. Located unseemingly near Pauline on Bloor street West, they definitely took a risk opening up in this somewhat seedy Toronto neighbourhood. But regardless the risk, it seems to have worked for them. Packed nightly with 20-something hipsters, it's difficult to get a seat if you show up past 8 or 9 o'clock, but don't let any of that stop you. As far as 'Blansdowne' goes, bar-wise there just isn't much that competes with it. Three Speed is brought about by the same people that started the Communist's Daughter, and they also have some affiliation with The Dakota, so you can expect the same sorta crowd and atmosphere--and dare I say pretentiousness--that you'd expect to see in any of those spots. If you can find the dam place that is...Three Speed is difficult to notice. In fact, if you weren't directly looking for it or didn't know where it was, you'd probably go right past; and if it wasn't for the red lights strung about the front window spiking my curiousity, I probably wouldn't have ever discovered it either. So when you're walking around Bloor and Lansdowne, and you finally do find it and get inside, the hidden-factor sorta gives the feel of a Bloordale oasis.The inside of Three Speed is not what you'd expect by the near-crumbling exterior. Inside it's dimly lit, low-key, and seriously comfortable. With exposed brick, wood panels, and art galore, it's an easy place to want to hang out at.Scribbled on a chalkboard and suspended on the bar wall, Three Speed has a slightly random food menu that displays their feature items, like mussels served in 1 of 3 styles,  Lo, Med, and High, indicating 'speed' but not content. You can expect well-rounded flavours of lime, fennel, and roasted garlic. No mistake, these are mighty good mussels.  But if there's a bunch of you, and mollusks aren't your thing, I'd recommend the Party Plate. It's a nice spread of cheese, meat, and pickled goodness. If you're not the sharing type, I'd go with the sirloin burger. Although I've definitely had better, this is still a savoury and sizeable burger that won't disappoint you.Like I said, it feels like the neighbourhood is on the mend and slowly losing its feel of neglect. There are even a few other cool spots that followed suit and opened up in this neighbourhood, like Holy Oak and the Starving Artist; both businesses that are beginning to do well.If you're in the Bloordale area, hanging out at Three Speed is an easy, but slowly becoming not the only option. But the fact remains, these people have taken a crappy, ex-Karaoke dump in a less-than-desirable neighbourhood and turned it into something special that is directly impacting the culture of Bloordale and for that, they definitely deserve to be commended. Nice job Three Speed.",4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,1.471143195
4566,VBcmyBxAPcpzbbnPbFfttA,1,2/5/11,0,wkD3Yrzty5_iTBWmCN9qQw,4,"Out on a cold winter's week night, some friends and I thought we'd head to Terroni on Adelaide for a casual bite. Not having a reservation, on what appeared to be a very busy night, the hostess recommended that we try their new venture, La Bettola di Terroni, which was close by.Once we arrived, we were all immediately impressed by the glass-walled pantry in the entranceway. It is always comforting to find a restaurant that flaunts its freshness. To me, it screams, 'Come in! We know what we are doing!'We took the advice, and waited for a table in a very cramped entrance way. With three other patrons in front of us, the hostess desk seemed very busy, but soon we were greeted and seated having had a table reserved at the suggestion of the hostess at Terroni.The first thing we noticed, sitting at the end of a very long shared table, was how loud the music was. A mixture of 60s R&B and 70s Disco; it was far too loud. We actually couldn't even hear each other. Being a trio, I had to use my friend to the left to convey what I was saying to the friend sitting opposite me. At one point, while trying to explain my thoughts on my salad to the person across from me, they smiled, nodded, and asked 'so what salad are you having'? I'll admit the restaurant was packed, bustling, and full of all the noises that come with that, but despite that, the music was the biggest contributor to the noise.Our server soon appeared and did a great job answering all the questions we threw at him about red and white wines. He spoke well and seemed to truly care about recommending something we'd enjoy. Unfortunately, upon his return he gave the white to the red drinker and vice versa. To his credit, he noticed his own mistake and did not make it again with any of the refills.Looking at the menu, anyone familiar with Terroni will find a lot to like here. It is, as their website describes, a sort 'best of' all the food at Terroni, with something for everyone.Bread arrived with olive oil to dip. The oil had a nice earthy bitterness and was quite enjoyable. Our salads arrived soon after: a Giuggiolosa with mixed greens with Cambozola cheese, grilled peppers, pine nuts, black olives, honey and a Barbabietole e Caprino with roasted beets, goat's cheese, lamb's lettuce, pistachios, candied lemon zest, and anchovy balsamic dressing. The Giuggiolosa was slightly too sweet and could have used a few more of Bettola's exceptional olives to add some more saltiness, but the Barbabietole e Caprino was near flawless. The beets were well roasted, and the flavours all stood out, as they should have. Looking at the menu, one of my guests fondly remembered having eaten Arancini di Modica on a ferry ride once from Italy to Sicily, so out of nostalgia, we ordered them. Arancini are breaded and deep-fried balls of rice, cheese and other fillings. At La Bettola di Terroni, they're filled with mozzarella and a pork ragout. They were a step above their peasant food origins, but all of us agreed that they weren't spectacular, didn't live up to the nostalgia, and we wouldn't be compelled to order them again.Our pizzas arrived soon after. Having been to other Terronis before, I knew what to expect, and so we decided to split two pizzas between the three of us. Although thin crusted, they're not small.We ordered a Smendozzata, with sausage, red onion and gorgonzola on a tomato base, and a C't Mang with prosciutto, pear, walnuts and honey with gorgonzola and mozzarella on an olive oil base. The Smendozzata was classic Terroni style, and just as expected. The Gorgonzola was sharp and salty, and the sausage had a hint of fennel. Tasty. The C't Mang was also excellent, with the perfect combination of salty and sweet, and a nice sharpness from the Gorgonzola.Overall, it was a good meal. With La Bettola di Terroni, the Terroni family has added another feather in its cap. La Bettola di Terroni serves classic, Italian comfort food and serves it well. Besides the noise level, it's be a great place to take a date, bring the family, or bring friends.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,0.358408525
4574,fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg,3,4/1/13,1,jATJA_ZFrHZBtlgRphW_gg,4,"Playa Cabana Cantina is the latest restaurant to open in Toronto to fuel our newfound taco addiction in the city. It's located in The Junction at 2883 Dundas St. West (at Keele).Playa Cabana Cantina is the second location for Playa Cabana - with it's first location on Dupont (at Davenport). The Junction has accepted it well, considering there were absolutely no reservations available for the whole weekend - but they assured me that they keep the bar open for walk ins.So we walked in. Right away I was impressed by the decor, there's plenty of neon-lit signs including a shout out to JUNCTION - WEST TORONTO, and an ""Keep and Enforce Prohibition"" sign at the bar - perhaps a little tongue in cheek reference to The Junction's past as a dry neighbourhood until 2000.The menu here is set up a little differently than other taco favourites like Grand Electric or La Carnita. Instead of ordering tapas style - one taco at a time, Playa Cantina's menu includes everything from tacos and tostados to burritos and enchiladas along with a side of rice and black or pinto beans.We started off the meal with guacamole and chips. The chips arrived warm to the table and were extra crispy and fresh. The guacamole was smooth and not too spicy for our tastes. The bartender replenished the chips free of charge too, which is a great touch.Playa Cabana Cantina has a fresh oyster bar set up, and at $2 a shuck, we couldn't resist them. They were huge, no skimping here, and were served with horseradish and hot sauce. Then, we each ordered a set of tacos with a side of rice and black beans, after starting off with Amber Agave Margaritas.The Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos were served on a corn tortilla with melted cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. They came to the table piping hot, and the mix of brisket and cheese was perfect along with the extra crispy tortilla. They were reasonably priced at $14 for an entree.Next up was the Tacos de Pescado (Baja-Style fish tacos) for $13 . They were a little underwhelming in comparison. The breaded tilapia didn't have the substance to stand up to the guacamole and shredded cabbage filling. Usually I'm a big fan of a good fish taco but this wasn't the best I've had lately.Personally, I prefer picking and choosing different tacos to try instead of ordering them as a personal entree. The sides of yellow rice and beans were fresh and a great addition, but it would have been great to try a few different kinds of tacos instead of three of one kind.With another round of drinks coming, we felt the need for some dessert... Unsure of what to get, the bartender recommended the Mexican Flan, so we gave it a shot. After waiting a little longer than necessary (I think the kitchen forgot about us), our bartender arrived with the flan, which was actually 2 mini flan served with whipped cream. He apologized for the delay and said the dessert was on the house.Overall the personal service at the bar was great, the bartender gave us a lot of recommendations on what to order and was more than helpful. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual, it didn't have that 'too cool' vibe that many new restaurants are picking up on now.We definitely will be returning to try out the burritos and other menu items along with the amazing guacamole again too. The tacos were flavourful, with fresh, house made ingredients but not the best of what the city has to offer right now.",3,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,-0.715918198

Before I picked up the car, I asked what the 'other' charges were on my bill (amounted to about 1/3 of the price) and she didn't know. When I mentioned the car was dirty and had a strong smell, she told me I was wrong because she cleaned the car herself.Any attempts to fix the situation with the location were fruitless as I was told multiple things by multiple people and nothing ever came of it for weeks even though I called back once a week to try and discuss the situation. I finally went through Avis' customer service who solved the issue and they provided excellent customer service.I'd like to stress the following: as a company Avis is great, it's this particular location that seems to employ rude employees and is owned/managed by a woman whom they called ""Mrs. Mary"" who does not seem to value her customers or giving good service of any kind.

I do agree seating is tight especially if you get a table in the corner by the windows.  The music is contemporary indian.  The food was just ok.  I visited during restaurant week and there was a limited menu.  However, you are fee to order off the regular menu as well.  I ordered the cucumber avocado soup, the chicken, and the mango kulfi for dessert.  The avocado soup was not good.  I found it to be bland and the texture off.  The chicken was dry and needed more sauce to get by.  The mango kulfi was ridiculous and had deep flavor.  If you are looking for a serious Indian restaurant - this is not the place for you.

First, the soup was flavorful and had a  little fire to it which I loved.  Second, the spring rolls were fresh with a nice assortment of fresh veggies that came with a sweet peanut sauce.  Lastly, the chicken and steak teeriyaki was great.  Many places you go (especially at this price point) will simply throw some veggies down and mix in the teriyaki sause.  Not here.  Instead, I found a great mix of broccoli, peppers, onions, mushrooms etc.  And yes, the mushrooms were big as another reviewer stated.  However, who complains that their mushrooms were too big?  The chicken was full plump pieces and the steak was just ok.  The rice was delicious and not doused in soy sauce.

The owner was very nice and the company was licensed and bonded so we thought we were in good hands.  We had the owner come and look at our brand new home and give us an estimate of painting the inside of our home.  The price was reasonable and being that we found this company at the home show and because the company was licensed and bonded we hired them to do the job.  We were told the job would take 4 days and we checked on the progress every day.  Again this is our brand new never lived in home, on the last day of painting we checked on the progress only to find the painting was completed along with major damage to our brand new shower.  The owner did not call us when the damage occured and when we contacted him he fessed up and apologized that one of his workers had fallen off a ladder and broke an entire slab of stone in our shower and promised to take care of the damage.  When we asked why we were not told when it happened the owner said he was trying to come up with a solution first.  Seemed odd to us we werent told immediately but let it go.  We then had to get the original stone installers to our new home for an estimate and provided the estimate to the painter.  The owner of the company did send us a check for the difference of what we owed him and the damage to our stone which is still not yet fixed as it had to be ordered so we have been without a shower now for over two weeks.We thought this would all be behind us and that it was just an unfortunate accident that wasnt handled very well.  That was until we found further damage to the outside of our home.  It was obvious more damage was done by the companies workers!  They had dragged a pallet of paint from our gate to our back door in our backyard.  The pallet was left in our backyard and we were able to trace the lines the pallet made all the way to its last ending point.  Based on the tracks it appears the workers pushed the pallet around the corner of our house and pulled so hard it removed the stucco and paint from the side of our BRAND NEW house.  I was never advised of this damage either and when we emailed the owner of the company we never received a response.  We are beyond dissatisfied with this company based on the damage they did to our home not once, but twice and how it was handled.  We have never written a review on a company before and have never been so dissatisfied and wanted to warn others of our experience with this company.

Usually I wait 10-15 minutes at each appointment, which is bad enough, but this time was the worst.  For this last appointment, I was asked to come in 10-15 minutes early to complete new paperwork due to management or ownership change, I wasn't clear on the reason.  Anyway, I arrived early as requested, completed my paperwork and was shown to the procedure room on time.  I should say that the receptionist was unsmiling and bordering on rude.  In addition, the person who showed me to the room was not knowledgeable and evasive with my two or three questions, telling me to ask the doctor on each of them.  Thirty minutes later, no one had come to inform me of a reason for the delay, or an estimate of how much longer the wait would be.  In fact, I thought I was forgotten.  So I went to the receptionist, who informed me that the doctor was with a new patient and should be finished any minute.  No apology, or even acknowledgment of my inconvenience; in fact, her attitude was almost to the effect of feeling bothered.  After returning to the room and waiting another 5-8 minutes, I left after being at my appointment for more than 50 minutes.  I had rearranged my work day and simply did not have time for the procedure, especially since I had no idea how much longer I'd have to wait.  In my opinion, Dr. Figueroa and the staff at Golden Apple do not respect their patients' time, or at least that of their existing patients.  New patients, beware.  I certainly hope Golden Apple does not have a policy to charge for missed appointments.  That would be a joke considering the disrespect they show their existing patients through the complete lack of regard for their time.

Hostess told us only a 20 minute wait, ended up taking 45 min, I love Korean BBQ so it was worth the wait. The crappy part of waiting was watching parties the same size or with 1 more than our party get seated first. I decided to ask and they said that a table of 5 had to be seated first because the table of 5 was ready (we he 4 in our party) not sure how that worked. Once we were seated we were greeted right away and I was ready to order. I asked for the premium steak, 2 orders of brisket and the marinated steak. They ended up bringing everything except for the second brisket. You are allowed to order 4 meats, every time we asked for more than 1 of a meat they wouldn't bring it. Service was really good at first, It went to a crap after the first 30 min (it's a 2 hour minimum) which is fine but me and the wife didn't leave full at all. Our waiter seemed to try and not make eye contact every time he walked by, we would have to ask the busser or anyone else that walked by for our next meat. Once we were ready to go, I looked over he check and they charged my 4 year old and 2 year old 10$ each for all you can eat. They both only had rice.... Not sure how that works.

5166,4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,0,10/16/15,1,tfNMdLwuDvAxSfQQO8HWzA,3,"Recently came to this ramen spot on an impromptu ramen tour with my boyfriend when we were visiting Las Vegas. I would consider myself a ramen connoisseur of sorts. I tend to seek out new ramen spots frequently. I've been spoiled with the likes of Shin-sen-gumi and Santouka so I have standards set pretty high.Per my fellow Yelpers positive reviews for Ramen Sora I visited to taste their ramen.Experience as follows:-Ambience: great spot, friendly staff. Nothing in particular stands out, typical privately owned Japanese ramen shop. We went around 2 for a late lunch, place was not full.-Service: service was prompt and mostly friendly. I wouldn't say they went out of their way to give us great service, but I have no complaints on quality or speed of service.-Food: we ordered the pork fried rice, shoyu ramen, and the shio ramen. We aren't particular for toppings so we usually go plain (bf) or with negi and egg (me).*pork fried rice: it tasted great. Perfectly seasoned, great balance of pork and flavor. Rare is the day when we get a delectable side more appetizing than the main course. *shio ramen: broth was weak and had an undesirable aftertase. Noodles were nothing special and the seasoned egg was flavorless. I was very disappointed in the broth.*shoyu ramen: this was my bf's meal. His words: ""it's plain"". I believe one thing that makes ramen delicious is its ability to give you complex flavors. When a broth is nothing more than dashi stock and soy sauce, you've got a problem.Overall/last remarks: while the ramen wasn't particularly good or special, I don't think this is a bad spot. Anyone who likes to have a variety of broths/styles would come here. But for me, I'm very particular about a ramen spot to take pride in their ramen. Generally that's done when a spot takes care to perfect a particular broth or soup. When they stretch themselves too thin their ramen tends to suffer. I would recommend this place to newbies or anyone looking for a decent lunch spot.",0,L4l2BQapWZaEk3xTI0h9Hg,-0.571978622

And I don't live anywhere near BFG. It's that good. The first time in I had the fried strips which were cooked perfectly. The batter was excellent and not greasy at all. The chicken inside was moist and tasty. It comes with two dipping sauces. I tried the teriyaki and the honey mustard. Both were very good. Along with the strips I had the vegetable skewers, which also were really tasty. The meal came with a small piece of garlic toast and a drink.My second time in I had the baked chicken strips which were moist and tender, and because I liked the veggie skewers so much the first time I got them again. Once again they came with Texas toast and a drink. All this for under 6 bucks.During the first visit my friend asked me how these chicken strips compared to Cane's. It had been a long time since I'd been to Cane's, so today I went there to compare. Cane's was decent, but nowhere close to as good as the chicken strips here at BFG.The service, as has been mentioned already here many times, was excellent. In fact the only complaint I have about this place is that it's so far from where I live. If they ever open one closer to me I'll be in there all the time.",0,EmIdjVdvb8EOo2yDf_OIaw,0.191106409

But if you too tried their croissant-aux-amandes-et-chocolat, you'd more than just understand, you'd be committing the same abhorrent actions as I. You can't but capitulate to the yearnings of your stomach sometimes, and it cries shamelessly for fous desserts and Mamie clafoutis.

They're not the largest, just the fattest. They sprinkle a GENEROUS helping of almond slices on the croissants, and load it with their almond filling, which resembles a custard more than a paste, and they use untempered milk chocolate opposed to the typical tempered dark/semi-sweet chocolates....so it's not only sweeter and milkier, but it is smoother and malleable. Like buttta!They also have a chocolatier in the back teasing the patrons with his bucket of couverture chocolate.

I lived in Madison for a few years before moving up north and the Old Fashioned was one of my absolutely favorite places. So when Bob and I returned to Madison after years of being away, it was the one place that I absolutely had to return to. This is the place, after all, that gave me my favorite drink - the Old Fashioned. We arrived on a Saturday and the place was PACKED! Not unusual, we were prepared. We put our names down and they have a neat new system where they text you when your table is almost ready. So you are able to leave and grab a drink somewhere else (I would strongly recommend Merchant) while you are waiting. We waited for about 45 minutes and were quickly seated near the window in the main front room. Our server was fast and friendly and brought us our drinks lickety split. I (of course) had the Old Fashioned and it was just as good as I remembered - but different than I drink them now. They use Korbel Brandy and Sprite, I am used to having Bookers and water. They are sweeter than what I am used to - but still really good. We had the cheese curds, which are far and away the best cheese curds in the Midwest... maybe tied with the ones at the MN State Fair. There is less breading and more cheese than other places and they are SO good. Bob got the slow roasted pork shoulder and I got the house burger. They were both SO SO SOOOOO good! The burger was a sloppy, messy, drippy concoction of deliciousness and the sandwich was the perfect balance of spicy, sour and sweet. The food has an ""upscale down home"" quality to it. It's not super traditional fare, there are some surprises with the food but it's still familiar enough that it's really approachable. Everything about the place felt familiar and awesome! My only (TINY) complaint is that the tables near the host stand are subject to the door opening and closing, so during the winter it can get a little chilly there. If you are in Madison and really want to experience some exceptional Wisconsin food, then you NEED to come here.

What better way to spend time with the one you love than wandering the strip with a colossal drink in your hand? We woke up early Saturday and ventured over to the Bellagio to enjoy their legendary breakfast. I have never been to a restaurant where the entrance looks like the entrance to the Incredible Hulk ride in Orlando. Winding around several velvet ropes till you reach the pay counter and receive your buffet ticket. There were 6 of us total, and the process was actually very smooth. We were seated quickly with a smile. We then wandered the absolutely endless amount of food options in the buffet line. I mean it was 10:00am, but they had everything from scrambled eggs to sushi. The only thing that was missing was any sweet breakfast item (who doesn't have pancakes or waffles?) All in all, the food was above ""meh"". I can't say that I was blown away, but I wasn't horrified either. I was not expecting it to be that good given that it was a buffet situation, but overall - it was pretty... average. Would I go back to this restaurant? Probably not.

It's just, again, mediocre. My husband, who grew up in east coast, was not impressed.3) Pan Roast with extra Lobster - they do give you a large portion of lobster. I found the dish just OK. Too buttery, fatty, and much of the same taste. (You can share this dish between two people... it's huge). You can also add spiciness - 1-10. A group next to us ordered 12. Whoa.I think I understand why people do like this place: If you are a seafood fan, the restaurant gives you large portions of crabs, lobsters, shrimps, oysters, and clams for budget-friendly price. I also realize the taste caters more to people who indulge in very rich, buttery foods. I wished I tried their jambalaya or any of the chef's specials - those do look better.

They wouldn't even make the appointment and that is what upset me!Dear Margaret,I have spoken to the three women who interacted with you last Friday morning and on Sunday evening. To a person they describe your behavior as rude and belligerent. The packet you were mailed last October was quite explicit in stating that you are required to submit a copy of your child's birth certificate in order to have your daughter baptized. This is in accord with diocesan policy, and is in place for a variety of reasons. We do not deviate from this policy.In that you appeared in the office on Friday morning, it is obviously not out of the question for you to also stop by your safety deposit box to retrieve the certificate. As Judy told you on the phone, we are quite flexible in arranging for baptism appointments that meet the needs of the parents, and will be happy to do so with you. Having all the requested information in hand at the time of your appointment ensures that everything is in order for your child's baptism. Our goal is to serve the needs of our parishioners as best we can, but we also rightly expect some cooperation from them as well. We will be happy to work with you and your husband to arrange for the baptism of your daughter and will set up an appointment at your convenience once you submit her birth certificate.

We're recent arrivals, and were so disappointed with the dog park in Champaign -- basically a boring piece of dirt with a bedraggled tree or two  surrounded by an entirely too short 4 ft. fence. Someone suggested checking out the Urbana dog park (they have reciprocity between the two parks) - it's like night and day! The Urbana park has several wide swaths of open, grassed area that is perfect for dashing around, frisbee, tennis balls, or just running for a dog's sheer joy of running.  The grassed areas are punctuated by some meadow-like areas of prairie grass, which was pretty in the late summer with wildflowers, although I was a little nervous about the possibility of snakes.  There's a very welcome wooded area with benches -- some really lovely big trees provide shade.  The park is well-cared for, with lots of mulch in well-traveled areas, lots of doggie bags (but only one trash can, by the gate - still trying to figure that one out), fresh water, a hose for those ""roll in the dirt"" days, and even a port-o-potty for humans who can't hike a leg by the nearest tree. There's a separate small area for small dogs, too, but it doesn't seem to be used very much -- a lot of people bring their small dogs into the ""big dog"" section, but it would depend on how comfortable your dog is around other dogs. With our escape artist dog, who considers any fence a challenge to be conquered, we were especially concerned about gaps in the fence, so one of the first things we did was walk the perimeter carefully.  Any areas that look as though a dog might be able to quickly dig under have been blocked with large rocks, and the gates are well-fitted, preventing a dog from nosing out in gaps caused by sagging gates.  And the fence is a good, 6' high chain link--perfect for jumpers like mine. That 4 ft. fence in Champaign would just be a suggestion, if mine saw a squirrel on the other side.  The picture on the Urbana Parks website, http://www.urbanaparks.org/facilities/55.html,  is a horrible one and makes it look like an urban wasteland.  Click on the video on that page, and you'll see just how pretty this dog park is. Yes, there is a fee -- contrary to what the park website says, we were only charged for a half-year when we registered in August.  $38 per year for the first dog, or $5 to visit.",5,UFTMDL3kjEY81aUDskxNAw,-0.703815941

Both were really BAD experiences in more ways than one.I'll address my last visit which occurred a few weeks ago.   Without getting into the medical details, let me say the waiting room was completely empty when we arrived, so we got right in.  The layout if the patient rooms is L-shaped while nurses station in the center.   After a doctor did the initial examination, we had to wait maybe 45 minutes until more tests were done.  That is not a problem, but what was a problem is the loud nurses outside our room discussing everything from their dates last night, to other patients.  Yes, they were talking about patients, and NOT in a good way.  There was do door to close, just a curtain, so it was pretty hard NOT to hear it. Very unprofessional.As we waited another doctor we had seen before entered our room and told us ""good news"" the test result was negative for this one test.  He then leaves, and I start thinking, and I ask my wife, did you ever have that test?  Without going into details, my wife KNOWS she never even had the test the doctor just claimed was fine.  Sure enough, later on, another doctor comes in and actually does that test. During our time there we definitely had more interaction about the billing charges and how they would get paid then by doctors actually giving us useful info.  As it turned out, they actually didn't do that well of a job medically as well.   Without going into details, they missed things they should of found.  Also, afterwards we get more than $1200 in charges from doctors that are out-of-network, or feel, for whatever reason they don't take our insurance, although this hospital IS in-network for our insurance.

So I'm being compared to the same size home, gas heat, pool, and where I work from home. Really.  We have this thing called the Internet that lets you customize things like this.  So the account page gives me a ""breakdown"" of my charges.  $10 for water heating? Really, it is gas. No pool?  Hmm, I do have one. $12 cooking. Hmm, that is gas too.  Why even present this on my account when its totally BS?

How come MOST companies provide an account for FREE.So the bill says it costs them $33.20 to generate the electricity, and $22.86 to deliver it?  In other words, it costs them $22.86 to deliver $33.20 of electricity?  Between metering, reading the meter and billing it is another $9.00  Overall, their costs, not including any tax or things like that which are out of their control, including $4.27 for a ""system benefits charge"" is over $60 of a $122 bill?  Were just talking inefficiency here, NOT actually paying for electricity.  APS is great at at telling us a make-believe scenario at how we are using their electricity, but you don't see them telling us how THEY are wasting our money.   This is a perfect example of how a lack of any competition can affect you.  Just like the medical industry, they can charge you almost anything they want.  You may think the Public Service Commission helps here but it does not.

I am quoting them exactly.  When I complained to the owner, there was never a response.

My jacket is originally white in colour, but was stained yellow over the years. The first time I came to collect my dry cleaned jacket from these guys, I came home to examine it. Not only did it not smell of any cleaning chemicals as is the norm, it was still stained. I returned and commented on the not properly dry cleaned jacket and also pinpointed the still visible stains. They took it back to be dry cleaned a second time without charging me extra. When I came back to collect my jacket which had now supposedly been dry cleaned for a second time, not only were the stains still there, I found new stains, those of ink stained fingerprints.So not only did these guys not dry clean my jacket the second time, they left their ink stained fingerprints all over it.Final verdict: THEE most horrible place to do your dry cleaning. You're basically paying for them to hold on to your clothes until it's time for you to come and collect them.I should add that I went to another place to have my jacket dry cleaned, and it came back whiter than I've ever seen it, which proves that it was indeed never properly dry cleaned, if at all, the first and second time around by Fast and ""Good"" Cleaners! Instead of going back a third time to complain, I figured a bad review would go a longer way as I hate being taken for a ride.

I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. It helped that before we entered, there was a sign on the door up front saying that they only accepted cash, a bit of a nuisance, but better to know before you go in than after you've eaten your meal.My first impression was it was very buzzy, great music playing and beautiful art work on the wall for sale to keep your attention. After putting our name down on the waiting list and waiting 20 minutes for a table (we played the cross-word while we waited) we were seated next to the kitchen, which is an open one.The service was friendly and fast, although the table we were sitting at was a bit small. You can choose from ordering off their menu or from the blackboard above the cafe area. I found that the menu was a bit more simple to follow, whereas the board was a bit too confusing.We both ordered the Mitzi's Breakfast Special ($6.95), coffee and a large glass of OJ (freshly squeezed, $4). We also found that sausage is not served here, but bacon instead. When asked why this was, the waitress simply said that they prefer to carry one type of meat. The wait was about 15 minutes for our food, but the art work on the wall kept us entertained. The food was absolutely delicious!! Where do I begin? The roasted potatoes, mmmmmm, nothing like I've ever had before. Roasted in some kind of pasta sauce with a hint of vinegar. When I asked the waitress for the recipe, she kindly said that it was a Mitzi's special and that it cannot be shared, smart girl! The bacon was oh so good with a hint of smokiness to it. The toast was pre-buttered (nice!) and our poached eggs were just right. And for $6.95, what a deal!! $24 total bill.The only draw back to this place was the lack of ventilation. Because the kitchen is an open one, it got pretty warm and the faint smell of the cooking was left in our hair and clothes. All in all, a really great place with delicious, reasonably priced food! It's not surprising that it has spread to two other locations.",3,MGU_MeGj51wBjhD0T8vUgA,-0.412832019

I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. Our first impression when we arrived was comfy. It wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. The service was friendly and fast, although when we asked if the heater beside our table could be turned on (it was chilly), we were assured that it would be, but unfortunately this did not occur. So we were pretty much glued to our cups of coffee to keep us warm, which was very tasty. The waitress was even kind enough to inform us of where their coffee came from, a nice touch of table side romance.Little things I noticed (I'm all about the small details) is the table sugar was stored in a container used for salt, which when poured streamed out at a snails pace. I liked the menu though, only one page and very simple, although a bit pricey. But seeing as the location is a prime one, I guess this makes sense. We ordered the Breakfast Platter ($13) and were told that it was quite filling for once person, so for two it would hit the spot. And seeing as I always ate less than my boyfriend anyway, we thought this would be the perfect choice. As an add on to the dish, we could also choose a side of beef for $2, but we substituted for bacon and sausage. Our meal was delivered approximately 25 minutes after ordering, which was quite a wait considering it wasn't a busy morning (two other occupied tables). The pancakes were nice and fluffy, although our sausage and bacon were quite disappointing, with one and a half strips of bacon and two sausages the size of a pinky finger. The sausage was good with a spiciness to it which was lovely. Our eggs came out fried even though we asked for poached. All in all, the Breakfast Platter didn't hit the spot at all, as we were still quite hungry afterwards. The bill was $27 in total, although we noticed we were charged $3 for the one and a half strips of bacon and $3 for the two pinky size sausages. When we questioned this discrepancy (as it said $2 side on the menu), and our surprise at the ridiculous price, we were given an embarrassed shrug from the waitress. Even though the food was good, we will not be coming back.",3,MGU_MeGj51wBjhD0T8vUgA,0.640490642
5706,XmgdFa3G_CZVfjtQEJMZfQ,2,5/26/11,1,I9RjHgYvhlNUAGehRMAIdA,4,"Myself and my party stumbled upon this place by pure chance as we were actually heading to another brunch place which apparently was closed...on a long weekend!!My first impression was spacious! And I just loved the cute little bar, back rest counter high white stools and a full drink selection. Only around for a year and a half, it seemed to already have made a name for itself, with its handful of cut out newspaper reviews proudly framed on the wall as you walk in (and the first thing you would see, which was a nice touch to the place). We guessed from the blown up photo of some dude in a chef outfit crossed armed and full of attitude was the owner/chef himself. All this gave a nice personal touch to the place.Once seated, we were served right away by an eager waitress. I ordered the 'Breakfast Special' ($9), although you're tempted to say 'I'll have the Breakfast Special 9' as the number '9' reads as part of the dish name instead of the price itself, perhaps something that can be improved on just for ease of clarity. After the fumble, we were reassured that many make the same mistake. Tea or coffee was included in the special, so I ordered earl gray tea, which was served in a small teapot compressor.The menu was the actual table mat, blue and white in color with a fair selection of items. We noticed that their smoked meat sandwich's were a big hit, something to try for next time. We also noticed that the milk was annoyingly served in a small tin container, and there being 5 of us in total, it became a bit ridiculous asking the waitress to keep making multiple trips back to the kitchen to keep re-filling the tiny buggers!Four of the five meals came out after a 30 minute wait; my boyfriends came out 15 minutes after that. This was a bit annoying to be honest, but compensated for after receiving an apology from the waitress along with a five dollar coupon for our next visit (we're easily pleased) always a nice touch and appreciated. Although for that even extra nice bit of touch (going the extra mile as they say) it would have been even nicer for the 'don't mess with' owner/chef guy to come out in person and apologize for the long wait. I never understand why some restaurants don't do this, it shows the restaurant cares just that little bit extra, changing the customers opinion of the place from 'I got a fiver for my next visit' to telling their friends about it. I saw Mr. attitude himself so he was there.The meal was nice and the portion size just right. Eggs were a bit too runny, always a favorite! But their hash browns were yummy, complimented very well with the apple sauce addition. Their bacon was a bit too hard and their fruit salad was just that, fruit! Nothing really here to get me to come back, although I wanna try that meat sandwich!!The total bill for the two of us was $27, not bad for what you get. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll give it another shot, I mean we do have that fiver :)",2,MGU_MeGj51wBjhD0T8vUgA,-0.899489275

She walked out the front door and quickly returned, back to the kitchen and handling food. We left and my husband asked the manager why he lied and why this was okay to endanger so many people with someone who was so very sick. He said nothing and was very lax in his overall concern for health. Very disturbing and gross!!! Real shame because we use to go here all the time.",0,ZZFc_eEaW0l_yrTRAEjBPw,0.93839456

That's only word I can think of when I think of Phoenix Motor Company. I've never gone online and taken the time to write a review of anything! But I felt compelled to warn others. Please, whatever you do, do not go to the Phoenix Motor Company for service. I've spent over thirteen thousand dollars in the last year (in one year! for a car with less than 60k miles on it) on repairs and every single time I leave there is yet another issue that undoubtedly costs 2-3 thousand more dollars. At first I thought it was smart to get dealer repairs as they would ""know"" what they were doing, right? However, every single time I have them do something, immediately something else goes wrong. Immediately. And to top that off, they charge a good 30% more than what you would pay at a local auto shop. Last April I promised that I'd never use them again, but last week they were the only ones with the part I needed - so I gave it another two thousand dollar shot. Two days after the day they said it would be ready I pick it up only to notice that it is shifting hard. I bring it back and of course it has nothing to do with the transmission work they JUST DID and now I need to spend 2-3 thousand more dollars. Don't end up feeling like a sucker like I do.

When we made the move in our RV to Las Vegas, we met Faith and Heidi Tuai in the office. They gave us a very detailed overview about the current market and answered all our questions about the different areas in Summerlin. Then we went house hunting for 1 1/2 weeks, changing our mind about the ideal house several times. Seeing the houses, yards, neighborhoods in reality is a much different experience then just exploring them on the computer. Heidi and Faith guided us through this very emotional decision process. We had always experienced that they put our personal interest first. Heidi and Faith never tried to push us in any direction or to higher priced properties.

Dishes were whisked away as soon as the food vanished from our plates and glasses were refilled before we realised they were empty. The wine selection is impeccable, but expect to shell out for a bottle-- there were few options under $50.00. We dined omakase (multi-course meal where dishes are chosen by the chef) and were given detailed descriptions of each course by the chef, himself, who was even so kind as to make separate versions of dishes for me, the only pescatarian of the group. We had the Jatoba salad with lobster pieces, spice-crusted beef carpaccio, a variety of sashimi from Albacore to Blue fin, another course of every type of dumplings, gigantic pieces of succulent shrimp tempura, seared scallops in browned butter, ginger lobster with grilled gai lan, and my coworkers even had the beef with grilled foie gras, while I opted for the buttery grilled king oyster mushrooms.  Each dish was a marriage of fresh and interesting flavour profiles, with classic additions such as grilled shishito pepper and pickled daikon to dwarf peaches and cucumber mixed with the lovely texture of roe and the melt-in-your-mouth fish. Delicate flavours were preserved, yet paired with bold tastes which would please even the most discerning of palates.Even the desserts were exquisite; although none of the eight of us has a particularly sweet tooth, we couldn't turn away the last course, which was plates of the mango curd tart with meringue brul̩ and green apple sorbet and a great take on the humble but delectable pouding chomeur topped with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberries. In all of my experience dining out, I can easily say this was one of the top three meals I've ever had.

Well, make that a big plate.I ordered the Chicken Sag and Spinach Nan (Yeah, I'm a big spinach fan). The Sag had the wonderfully creamy, soothing taste I was hoping for. That dish is my comfort food. The Nan was freshly baked and piping hot. My husband had the Lamb Vindaloo and Aloo Paratha. The Aloo was slightly underseasoned for me, and my husband always orders things ""hot,"" so the Vindaloo was good, but too pungent for my taste. Not for the faint of heart. The flavor was right on, though.All the food had the complex and earthy Indian spice combination that I've never been able to recreate at home, but love so much. I'm so jazzed about this place. They're a little out of the way. I would have driven right by them if I hadn't known that they're set back off of the road behind another business (sorry can't recall which one).

Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. My feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. I'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating.

Maybe I ate here at the wrong time, totally sober, and fresh off of the airplane.  My hunger was satisfied, and I must have liked it to a degree, as my plate was pretty much clean, but reflecting back on it, my experience was simply, ok.  There was a total of 6 guys that I went with, and we each got different things, so I was able to sample a couple of things other than what I'd ordered.  Shanghai Noodles was my choice.  It's a dish of wok-fried noodles with napa cabbage and pork.  The plate looked and smelled good, but the noodles were truly too oily.  I honestly couldn't help but think of Michael Jackson's 1980's jheri curl, so I suppose I can say that the noodles were straight up greasy.  However, one of the guys at my table got beef congee.  It had that nice thick porridgey texture that I love, not watery, as I've experienced at too many other establishments.  Also, the beef was tender, which I previously thought was impossible in a soup.  Though the noodles, their flagship product, aren't my favorite, I can say that they had excellent service.   We were seated immediately, and almost as soon as we sat down, water was at our place settings.  Additionally, time between placing our order, and when the first dish was delivered, was relatively quick, and when it arrived to the table, it was piping hot.  It is one of the ""casual"" dining spots in The Venetian, so don't expect a meal to write home about.  However, as I hinted earlier, if you're in need of balancing your liquid-to-solid ratio, after boozing, then head on over there.",0,9QrE24JaemD3TLFihmTKxg,0.394878823

We called in to a popular HVAC company to get a recharge of freon. The inspection pointed to a leak in the evap coil. Called home warranty company, was given several horrid companies to do the work. Did a Google search and STB came up as the top rated result in the Gilbert area. Thankfully, we were able to choose our own contractor for the job!Called and spoke with Ashley, who is AMAZING at ensuring you are treated like royalty, is very knowledgable, and answers all my crazy OCD questions (and should receive a raise! ;)) She told me someone will return my call with an estimate. Ryan, who is equally amazing, called back almost immediately and sent me an estimate within twelve hours. He then came out after business hours to do a second diagnosis inspection. (Ryan also deserves a raise! ;)) It turns out it, in fact, IS the evap coil leaking.The next morning, I get a call at 7:30am saying that the installers will be there at 8:00am. Danny shows up and expediently gets to work, removing the offending coil. Dean shows up a little while later with the new coil to replace it. (Again, Danny and Dean deserve a raise for working in the hot attic for a couple hours!) The install went well and both were very efficient in doing their work. They were also very friendly, which is refreshing to see with installers!Additionally, Ashley helped setup the communications between STB and my home warranty company, which was really appreciated, as I was getting a bit annoyed by said warranty company at that point...Overall, I will say that because of the above and beyond service I received from Ashley, Ryan, Danny, and Dean, I will not hesitate to call them for any future HVAC needs.

Only the all-you-can-eat menu was given to us at first so it made sense (fyi menu says we would pay for some foods not finished). We ordered light apps and were told rolls were 6 pieces. Apps came out in very small portions of salads (seaweed/squid), so then we ordered a few rolls- small but delicious! So we decided on a couple others and before we know it, here comes a forgotten app and 2 huge 10 PIECE rolls that we could not possibly finish! Great sushi but heres the kicker...we were asked immediately if its our first time, if we lived near, how we found them, THEN each question over again! We were told we would need to pay for what we didnt eat...we honestly felt like we were in trouble for not finishing our plates! They ended up not charging us for extra 2 rolls (we had NO PROBLEM with paying extra), but were reminded 3 TIMES that next time we would need to pay. No need to treat us so differently when we didnt finish...bummer i was hoping this would be a good experience :/",2,hhb92hGbbl5Ye90usGWfIQ,1.614397607

I didn't want to go electronic and thought my only other option was hand-written.  I was so wrong!  I had heard great things about The Paper Place, so I went in to see if they could help.  Judy is the sales associate who worked with me and she is absolutely a delight -- knowledgable, creative, efficient and lovely personality.  In less than an hour, we selected the perfect invitation 'off the rack', received wording suggestions from Judy for all our particulars, decided on font, selected coordinated cocktail napkins with matching print font, and then she put a rush on the printing of the invitations and envelopes... no hand-written anymore :-).  She even suggested I buy floral stamps which I never would have thought of, but love. When the invitations arrived 2 days later, she helped me stuff and stamp, and suggested the main post office so they would be sent out that day.  And the price was very affordable.

I have very fine eyebrow hairs and went to Julia for microblading in the hopes of having beautiful, hassle-free eyebrows.  The result is that I am emotionally distraught and aesthetically maimed with mis-matched eyebrows now because of Julia's work.I take responsibility for not doing significantly more research before deciding on someone to do my microblading, or I certainly would not have selected Julia.  She lacks close-up photos of her work, has only 3 reviews on Yelp, and not many more on her website where she can cherry-pick the best ones.  But shame on Julia for trying to convince me that her microblading on my brows looked great, and that what I was seeing in the mirror was ""just a reflection"" and not what my brows really looked like.  Her analysis would be laughable if it was not so flawed and deeply upsetting.I last saw Julia about a month ago for a touch-up to the original work where she promised to ""even out my brows and make them perfect."" She did not improve the mismatched shapes at all, but only made them darker which I did not want.  Since then I have had numerous consulting appointments with professional microbladers and have heard a consistent theme to date... that my brows are definitely mismatched with one having a high arch mid-way in the brow, while the other is relatively flat with a rounded arch at the end; additionally, I've been told the brows are over-saturated so that the individual hairs are not visible which is the whole point of microblading to achieve natural looking brows.I can only pray that my brows lighten and completely disappear over the next few years.  At that point, if they have not completely faded, I will need to resort to time-consuming and expensive saline treatments to remove Julia's work before I can have my brows properly microbladed.  In the meantime, each morning I must re-shape each brow with a brow pencil to get a closer match so that I'm not embarrassed to go out.  Needless to say, the past several months have been emotionally devastating to me and I don't know what the future holds.Julia has offered to ""fix my brows"" if I come in for a third appointment.  In my opinion I would be crazy to let her work on me again given the outcome of my first two visits.  The damage is done.Buyer beware.",0,aRsyvbrZza5QEMFBeRGxLg,0.244657472

I live on the West side of Madison, and Blue Lotus is the place that all of the students at a my school go for tattoos and piercings.  After hearing great things from fellow students, I decided to drop in to get my ears pierced. I had had my ears pierced previously, but they closed up because I never wore earrings.  It was too much of a hassle to bring my mommy in with me to get a simple piercing, so I waited until I was 18 to get the piercing done.  I went in on my birthday and upon seeing my ID, the guy at the counter wished me ""happy birthday.""  I know that's not a big deal, but it definitely created a good vibe and little things like that in a skeptical situation can make a big difference.  There were people still waiting to get their piercings done, so I had to wait a bit before I was shown the jewelry.  After I picked my earrings out, I had to wait even longer to be escorted into a room.  I'd say overall, the wait time was probably about an hour.  I don't think that's Blue Lotus's fault, though.  It was busy, and people had appointments, and I did not.  Eventually I was taken back into a room by Myke.  He was very kind and thorough in explaining to me what was going to be done and making sure that I knew how clean the whole process was.  He washed his hands and changed his gloves numerous times and even though I'm a bit crazy about germs, I felt completely comfortable.  I turned out that my hole hadn't completely closed up, and Myke was able to just insert something through my ear the opened the hole back up.  There was a bit of pain, but nothing bad by any means.  I'm very afraid of needles, so I began to get dizzy when the first ear was done.  He kept asking me if I was okay throughout the entire process, and when I told him I was dizzy, he was extremely understanding and finished the other ear with my lying down.  After the piercings were done, he had me check in the mirror and explained to me the steps to take in the weeks to come.I didn't get a tattoo or a major piercing, but I can testify that the Blue Lotus staff, especially Myke, is professional, kind, and extremely careful about cleanliness and sanitation.  I would recommend Blue Lotus to anyone!Ear piercings at Blue Lotus cost $15, but mine was only $5 because it was just reopening a previous piercing.  My earrings were Neometal with CZ and set me back $60.

Naturally, I was quite nervous about the whole affair. I went in for a consultation with Jos̩, who spent a lot of time going over options with me and trying to find a style that would work with my face. Not once did I feel pressured to cut it if I didn't want to, and it was obvious that he had a lot of experience in making the most of someone's hair.Once the decision was made to start, he proceeded to spend a full hour trying three progressively shorter styles until we found one that made both of us happy. He made sure I wasn't given a style that would require too much maintenance (my previous hair maintenance routine largely consisted of washing it, brushing it, and tying it back, so I'm not one for too much fuss), but that could still be sculpted depending on my mood on any given day.His enthusiasm and attention to detail really made the whole process quite exciting, and I spent the rest of the day getting compliments from people - none of whom had ever seen me with short hair. Even the other staff members (and clients!) gave their approval, which meant a lot after so long away from the scissors. We won't even go into the reaction it elicited from my wife, though I will say it made it want to cut my hair more often.I really can not recommend Funky Toque enough.

She left after telling me she would get me a quote within the next day however, I did not hear from her for a week. After sending an e-mail to see when I would receive a quote- I got an e-mail with one the next day. After about a week of back and forth Q&A I told her we were ready to go forward with the project. I did not hear back from anyone after six days so  I sent Hali an e-mail on the 16th of September asking why I had not heard back from anyone, I finally got an e-mail from Mandy on the 17th; by that time had already decided to seek out another vendor. The vendor we talked with quoted us almost twice as much as what Fast Signs did, so I will commend them on their pricing. I had to ask them to revise the proof they sent to me four times because they kept sending me incorrect proofs. The first proof that was sent wasn't even a proof for our company.We paid half of the payment, and I let them know that we were ready to have everything installed except for one indoor sign, as we were repainting and doing some rearranging. They showed up with only one sign to install, and nothing else.

In the proof it did not look as big, so we approved it. After telling Sam about my issues with the slow response times, the multiple proofs, and the border width, he apologized, but offered no means to satisfy myself or my CEO.

Everything is laid out very nicely inside the dining area. Definitely a unique feel inside with the beautiful floor and ceiling and distinct tableware. The music that was playing in the background didn't match with the feel of the restaurant though.SERVICE [3/5]Waitress was friendly but was not very attentive to our table.

In hindsight, we probably should have asked the waitress to take it back.

The menu has tons of things I love to eat, so I have lots and lots of reasons to go back. My boy friend is just opening up to the cuisine, and I really hoped this place would wow him. It could have, but instead just - ummm - ""not bad""-ed him. More on that soon.The service was great. For a casual place, way out of the park. The waitress was on spot from the get go. Loved her. When the boy friend spilled an entire iced tea, her coworker came running to help and they both smoothed it over and cleaned up the mess. They even let him have another tea, even though I voted to cut him off since he'd clearly had enough.So why three stars? Some real bizarreness on their part. We both had soups, which we loved. I had a wrap, which was great. The hot stuff hot, the cold stuff cold, and everything delicious. He had a sampler with salad, rice, and three kinds of grilled meat. Which was great, except the rice was cold. Not warm, cold. Like grandma sat it outside in the snow cold. He immediately let her know, no problem she'll get hot rice. They just made it fresh. She just as quickly came back and said they would have to microwave it, there would be no fresh order of rice. He wasn't into the idea of microwaved salad and meat, nor the idea of someone picking his plate apart for him to microwave rice, which doesn't taste the best microwaved anyhow. He said never mind forget it. She wasn't liking that idea, kudos to her. She went to the kitchen and got a manager to pry the rice away from whoever was being so cranky about it, and brought it out a few minutes later.Yay! Fresh, cold rice. No joke, after she went to all that work to make his order perfect, they sent out cold rice a second time. He wasn't eating it so I stuck my finger in it to see - yeah, about the temperature of my carrot juice. Cool. Not warm. Not very appetizing, and not even a safe temperature to keep food. Silly thing to get wrong twice, I think. So aside from that, I was very, very happy with the place, and want to go back.

The egg and shrimp rolls are the only thing which is edible.  I had the curry chicken today.  It consisted of 99% onions and then some chunks of a white, watery, tasteless substance which was supposed to be the chicken.  Absolutely terrible.  I ate a few bites and gave up.  My wife had chicken with Chinese vegetables.  It was basically the same, 99% celery and then this mystery chicken.  My son had sweet and sour chicken, and he didn't finish his meal, which is very telling.  He said the chicken tasted funny and the breading as weird.  All in all, it was a waste of 19 dollars.

We were hoping for a drink and a small snack. Before we were seated the manager informed us that they were only serving the tapas menu, which was fine, and we expressed our desire to order food. There was one other table occupied inside the restaurant and we had the patio to ourselves. Apparently our waiter had to cut his smoke break short to attend to us. He came and took cocktail orders and said he would give us more time with the tapas menu. At no time on this 30+ Celsius day were we offered or brought water. When our drinks arrived the waiter placed them on the table, turned around and disappeared back inside immediately and without a word. We assumed someone would return, but were ignored on the patio. We sipped our drinks and eventually finished them. After several more minutes of waiting my wife went inside to tell them we were leaving. The manager offered to send the bill out. The waiter brought it out with a charge for French Fries that we didn't order. He told us it was Quebec law that their liquor licence required a food order. We told him we intended to order food, but didn't have the opportunity as he never asked us. We also told him we had no intention of paying for food we didn't order. He told us we could wait for the fries or not, but we had to pay for them. He lied and said he asked twice if we wanted to order food. When we refused again to pay for what we had not ordered he told us we could pay or just be thieves. We asked to see a manager. When the manager arrived the waiter continued to lie and say that he had asked twice if we wanted to order food. When we told the manager that this wasn't true he grabbed the bill, crumpled it and told us to ""f$!& off"". The manager was extremely apologetic and very nice. He comped our full bill.

I drove the car down here from the Portland, OR area, which meant that it got disgustingly dirty on the road trip down to Las Vegas. I am not a fan of automatic car washes, and I stumbled across Gloss It during my search of car detailers in the area. I gave Rich a call and he was incredibly friendly over the phone and said they could get me in within an hour and told me to come over. He was incredibly professional and friendly once I arrived, and took me through the shop and showed me around before his guys went to work on the car. He took the time to answer my questions regarding my own detailing techniques and was really informative regarding his products. Not only that, but he brought me the WiFi password to use while I waited for the car to get cleaned.The car came out looking awesome, and both the employees who did the detail work did a great job and were very friendly. Rich, the owner, comes across as a passionate and friendly businessperson, and it really seems like he knows his trade. If you care about your car and are looking for a good detail or want to look into detailing products to use at home, I'd highly suggest giving him your business.",2,v-ww7rqLp0IaZVXFwtqUKA,-0.122240874

It was as if they literally put us in their block of rooms. There must have been forty of them with no more than one or two chaperons.

TO which I was told ""I don't think I can,the cooks like it loud"" !!!  I mean REALLY? I'm only going to be in the place for the most 45 min's, you mean you can't lower the volume of the music for 45 min's? So I can enjoy a meal I'm Paying for!!  So let's finish the story, they lowered it a TINY bit, for 4 min's then a song one of the waiters liked came on, and he proceeded to turn the music back up, So again I asked if they would be so kind as to lower it, to which they turned it down soooo slightly that it made no difference at all..and after about 5 more min's it was back to it's original volume..at that point I was pissed beyond belief so I rushed ate my food and as soon as the last fork full was past my lips I left the restaurant and walked out the door, and my husband who was also bothered by the LOUD music didn't not leave a tip..

We had the oysters, slow poached farm egg, Parmesan bacon ravioli, gem salad, spring pea soup, Maine day boat scallops, veal cheeks, ginger cake, and chocolate torte (in order).

The duck was tender and cooked to perfection.Order your desserts early cos they might just run out of what you want.

It's enormous and a little intimidating at first--there are thousands of swatches (I'm used to looking at bolts of fabric) and dozens of staff.  I assumed that since there were swatches on display that most of their stuff would need to be ordered.  Turns out, the swatches virtually all represent in-stock fabric.  This news almost brought a tear to my eye.  In my two hours there I probably spoke to five or six of the staff and they were universally friendly and knowledgeable.  The place also has a really nice buzz.  There were lots of designers there, talking about client projects in private homes and on movie sets.  The customers and the staff seems to know each other and there was lots of good chit chat, sewing-related and otherwise.  There are well-placed tables and chairs where you can leave your swatches while you browse, then come back to sit down and calculate yardages.There was a wide range of fabric qualities/prices and I agree with other reviewers that their prices do seem to be lower than other fabric stores in the city.  Part and parcel of this is a no return policy, a 1/2 yard minimum and some restrictions about how much they will leave on a bolt.  Also, they don't allow returns of any kind, not just cut fabric.  It's just the kind of independent retailer that makes me bemoan the encroachment of big chains.

So instead of dinner at Nota Bene, we signed 10 documents in triplicate at Bloor and Ossington, then wandered, starving, into the first place we saw that looked interesting. It's definitely not fair to compare Queen of Sheba to Nota Bene, but in comparing it to other Ethiopian places I've eaten, in Toronto and elsewhere, it's really not in the same ballpark.  Do you want the good news or the bad news first?  Read bottom to top if you're a good news first kind of person.  The decor and cleanliness were really, really sketchy.  My husband and I (who were in a surprisingly good mood given the turn of events) commented that had it not been for fairly significant dining experiences in various developing countries, we would have high-tailed it out of there.  Just inside the front door we were greeted with the stale smell of cigarettes and just damp dirtiness; fortunately as we passed the kitchen and entered the dining room the smell greatly improved.  The carpeted(!) dining room was sorely in need of a shampoo.  The bathrooms were freezing cold and let's just say not spotless.  The paint in the dining room looked half-finished, with roller marks on the ceiling and some unfortunate color choices, and patches just not finished, like the painter quit half way through the job.  One upshot was the lighting, which was mostly from wall sconces pointing upward (not bad when ceiling mounted neon lights would have fit right in with the rest of the decor choices).The service.  Oh God the service. She was pleasant but either really ditsy or really high.  My husband asked what the premium beers mentioned on the menu were and she just shrugged and said she didn't know.  In a  nice way, though.  When we told her we don't eat red meat and asked if we could do a platter that was a mix of chicken and veg she seemed sort of confused.  She suggested we do the mixed platter, but minus the beef and lamb, about which I sought to confirm that that might mean more chicken and veg given the absence of the other items.  To which she responded, nicely, no.  Being hungry and in no mood to be difficult, we just ordered the mixed platter of chicken, beef, lamb and vegetables, and I proceeded to eat red meat for the first time in 18 months. The food was ok.  The beef was actually a highlight.  It was stewed in a dark sauce with a hint of sweetness.  The chicken was two drum sticks in a spicy sauce and the meat was tender and flavorful.  The lamb was nice as well, though the tender meat was done a disservice by a not very flavorful sauce.  The three vegetable dishes, a split pea, a lentil and a cabbage dish, were disappointingly bland (they made me glad we hadn't gone for the vegetarian platter).  And finally, the side plate of injera was right out of the refrigerator.  That sucked, actually.The best thing I can say is that the price was right.  For a huge platter of food for two plus three beers it was $40 plus tip.  That's a pretty good savings versus what we would have spent at Nota Bene...",2,uWeAWWzKpOl6o7V-BdtUGg,0.387639247

That's what I get for not reading the voucher all the way through!  All the same, I'm very glad I made that mistake because otherwise I would have never thought to go to Tacos 'n' Tequila for breakfast.We were there during the Sunday Mariachi Brunch.  I ordered the chilaquiles and my boyfriend had the albondigas.  Both dishes were wonderfully flavored and the portion sizes were more than sufficient; however the real star of our breakfast were our micheladas.  Hands down the best micheladas we've ever had.  A perfect blend of spicy and hearty.  Gave us just the pep we needed to start our day in Vegas!The service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly and we were even serenaded by the Mariachi Band.  They were taking table-side requests and my boyfriend asked for ""Guadalajara"" because that was the song his dad used to sing all the time when he was growing up.  They did a great job and made it all a lot of fun.I would have given this place 5-stars except for two small things.  1) You have to pay extra if you want eggs in your chilaquiles.  I know chilaquiles can vary from place to place, but it's been my experience that eggs are the main staple of the dish so it seemed odd they weren't included.  However the dish did include chicken, so it was still very filling, but I did miss the eggs.  2) No menudo.  I really wished they had it available.  The albondigas was tasty, but to me when you're looking for a really good hangover breakfast, you just can't beat menudo.",1,pplya_6D9ElaNXhoFvpZFg,0.269721736

If it hadn't been for that, I would have never even thought to eat at this place.  This was everything you would expect from a high-end restaurant: beautiful decor, ambiance, superior service.  I was extremely impressed that when the dining room doors were closed, you absolutely cannot hear any of the noise from the casino floor.  Quite the feat considering when were were there the table dancers were performing less than 50 steps away from the entrance to the restaurant.We started with the escargot.  It was incredibly fantastic.  I'd had escargot before and it was always my experience that they were a little bit chewy, so that is what I expected.  That was completely not the case here.  They were warm. soft, tender, buttery, and just enough garlic to get a really good flavor but it didn't punch you in the mouth or send you running for the mouthwash.For our entrees my boyfriend had the sauteed green-peppercorn filet of beef and I had the pan seared duck breast and duck sausage.  On my first bite I just melted.  Gave out and audible ""mmmmmm"" complete with an eyeroll....and again with the second bite....and again with the third....then I cut into the sausage and I nearly fell out of the booth.  Every bite was pure heaven.  I think my boyfriend was pretty sure he was going to have to take my upstairs for a smoke afterward!  I have never had duck so perfectly cooked.  Tender, juicy, and so full of flavor.My boyfriend was enjoying the same out of his steak.  He sacrilegiously ordered the steak ""medium"", which in my opinion instantly kills the flavor of the meat.  However it was so wonderfully seasoned that there was zero compromise in the flavor and so perfectly cooked that I'm pretty sure it could have been cut with a spork!For dessert we decided on the pistachio souffle with white chocolate sauce.  Completely fluffy, moist, sweet goodness in a bowl.  It stood beautifully and there was a wonderful crisp crunch to the outside, and oh-so-soft, warm, and melted inside.  The last bite where the white chocolate sauce had fused with and melted into the remains of the souffle was complete perfection.Normally I would scoff at dropping this much coin on a single meal, but this place is now going to be built into the Vegas budget.  I'm a year away from going again and already I'm craving this food.  We've already decided on the rack of lamb and Dover sole for the next round!",5,pplya_6D9ElaNXhoFvpZFg,0.688054701

I'm dizzy watching them spin, how're they not flying to their doom? These were just random thought came to mind. People put in work. No detail missed. Visually stunning.

The boutique has two sides: the upscale side and the consignment side.  The upscale side carried brands like Valentino, Miu Miu and lots and lots of St. John which is generally worn by a more mature and refined woman.  The prices on this side of the boutique were pretty high.  The cheapest thing I saw was a blouse for $150.  There is a clearance rack but I didn't see anything that I would even consider wearing.The consignment side of the boutique is geared more towards women who were born in the 1970s and beyond.  The brands that I saw on this side included: Juicy Couture, Marc by Marc Jacobs, and BCBG just to name a few.  Again, the prices were a bit high in my opinion, but definitely more affordable than on the upscale side.  This side also featured Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Coach handbags.  I will say that I found several clothing items that I liked but wasn't willing to pay for them as I don't really need another pair of pants, jeans, shirts, sweaters, jackets, dresses, or handbags.  Nowadays I only buy things if they speak to me and a montage of events in which I will wear the items flashes through my mind.  I did find a few items on the clearance rack that I liked and ended up buying a pair of Joe's Jeans.  The original consignment price was $69.50 (way too high for used jeans) and I got them for $17.

I figure who better to write a review on Texas Roadhouse than someone with years of experience.   I've never ordered anything that I didn't like.  The food is always well seasoned and tastes great.  Although it's not a meal (wish it was) my favorite thing to eat from here are the green beans.  Instead of getting two different sides with my order I get two orders of green beans!  I have no idea what makes them taste so good.  The only conclusion I've drawn is that they're laced with some type of drug because I'm addicted to them!!  The rolls with cinnamon butter are also delicious.  I've gotten full off of them plenty of times.On top of the great food the service is also really good.  There are also plenty of tasty treats on the drink menu.  Try the Jamaican Cowboy on for size.  This is a great place to bring your friends and family.  The prices are reasonable and this place should exceed your casual dining expectations.  I know they exceed mine!  Since this is a popular restaurant if you go between 6:30 and 8:30 you may have to wait a bit for a table.  It can get pretty crowded especially on the weekends.

Yet more damage to my vehicle from Penske Auto Glass. MY ADVICE IS TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM PENSKE AUTO GLASS.In response to Lindsey C's comment from Penske. I asked and I sent them the estimate for the repair of the chip they put on my door for $511.38, I also asked them to replace the rear view mirror their installer damaged with tool marks and sent them a picture of that damage. Lastly I asked for just $250 for loss of income and my time since I have had to take hours of my own time to bring the car to be repaired, and for estimates as well as hours of additional time I have spent dealing with all of this nonsense that They Penske Rapid Repair has caused. I addition have emails from Penske stating that they had not and would not bill my insurance for  the bad windshield repair. Here is the then actual quote from Jan 2 2013 ( ""Geico has not and will not be billed for the work performed."" ) as sent from Tabitha Wall, Operations Manager. Yet they did bill Geico,  and were paid for the work they said they would not bill for.  So much for being true to their word.Further more Lindsay C from Penske in her comment stated ""We have refunded the entire amount for the work performed to his insurer "" , but as of today Feb 14th 2013 according to Geico they have not yet done so. Again it seems that they have made another false statement of truth.Lindsay C also makes this statement that they ""have politely declined repeated requests for monetary compensation for his dissatisfaction"" The only single email request for compensation I have made was an email sent to Tabitha Wall at Penske to compensate me for the repair of my vehicle, that They Penske have damaged, and to recoup a small amount of money for all of the time I have had to take off, and spend rectifying the damage they caused to my car. I have not been unreasonable in any way. So I paid for my new windshield out of my own pocket $952.19, and have yet to be reimbursed from my insurer because as my insurance company has informed me that they have yet to be reimbursed from Penske, and since they consider this a warranty issue because of the damage Penske admitted them they caused, they can not pay me until Penske pays them back. I also have recorded phone conversations with a Penske rep Tabitha Wall taking responsibly for my door chip, yet they have refused to pay for the repair, or provide me with a replacement rear view mirror. So one should ask themselves this. What kind of business would damage your vehicle, admit that they did it, and then tell you that they would not bill your insurance , and then turn around and bill them anyway, Refuse to pay for the damage they caused, and then try to make you look like your the unreasonable one with a reply to your opinions and statement on yelp of what they Penske have been putting you through, and then also try to imply that they are perhaps the victim here and you are wrong. Answer: Penske Rapid Repair. PENSKE RADIP REPAIR STOP YOUR NONSENSE, AND DO THE RIGHT THING AND PAY FOR MY REPAIRS FOR THE DAMAGE YOU CUASED TO MY CAR. I will post a link here soon to all the recored phone conversations, photo's and emails.",7,Zj_jtU6B2d6rHaOE7LYmQA,-1.171887402

Having been lusting after the Indy boot and cordovan longwings for years, I was delighted to hear this, and Jonathan promised to email me when they received the first round of Aldens.Having moved to the menswear desert of Ottawa, I eagerly awaited to hear from Joanthan, who true to his word emailed me as soon as they had the Aldens in stock. Much to his credit, he patiently answered my emails regarding sizing and my request to set them aside for a friend to pick-up. With my order (I ended up going with the longwings--be jealous), much to my surprise and delight, he even threw in a pair of cedar shoe trees! This really blew me away because I do so much of my shopping online and you always end up having to drop another $30-40 on shoe trees; I really appreciated the gift and the human touch.Moreover, you won't find a better price for this type of footwear anywhere else, especially when shopping online (where it's truly awful to be Canadian). I had looked into ordering the longwings from Leffot in nyc, but with tax and shipping they would have come out to a full $140 more than what I paid at L&F! Likewise with Oak Street; L&F's listed price is cheaper than buying from OSB yourself, and you save on shipping. I couldn't be happier.To conclude, L&F is in a class of its own in the Canadian menswear game, stocking classic, rock-solid apparel you can't find anywhere else, and offering customer service that reminds you why supporting local stores like this is so important (that said, they have a great online shop as well). I'm going to be shopping here a LOT, and you should too.",0,GGepQDfAKXHGNvU-6OcaCQ,-0.39745498

Back when I used to visit Champaign, I'd get invited to go there for birthdays, graduations or simply if you want to grill minus the clean up.As mentioned by Melissa, they do have a variety of steak cuts with chicken and pork. If you're a steak lover, you should be able to find numerous nice cuts if you're willing to pay up. Back in the poor college student days, those nice steaks were difficult to avoid. Anyhow, once the steak had been picked out, you simply place it on the big grill, in the middle of the restaurant and you let it dance and sing. You also have the option of letting the waiters / waitresses to cook it for you. The grill is also used for garlic butter texas toast as well as potato-grilling.Besides the grill, there is a salad bar with a decent variety of salads, ranging from typical greens to creamy mac salads or creamy potato salads.Given a decent list of decent restaurants on the campus of U of I, Alexander's is actually worth while.

Also, my fianc̩s brother and I had both gotten a soda there, which each cost $1, they kepty fianc̩s brother's dollar yet gave back mine... Hmmm... I found this while doing some research.. ""Normally, in respectable tattoo shops, payment is due when services are rendered.  This means you pay when the session is finished, not before it has begun.  Large tattoos are paid for session by session, so you only pay for the work that was performed that day. (any shop that demands payment before the tattoo is done is probably accustomed to working with a shady clientele who are often trying to run out without paying.  This may mean that you are in a shady tattoo shop.  If you are shady yourself, or are okay with getting tattooed in a shady shop, stay put and carry on.  If you don't want to be tattooed in a shady shop, you might want to leave at this point)."" I would NOT recommend going to this shop",0,hZajiC3FN2LSjGQOtg_G0A,0.244097341
